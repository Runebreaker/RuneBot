It's red...
just like the color of her hair.
It's red.
Her hair is more crimson than strawberry blonde;
the same color is coating my hands.
The beautiful red of that long hair means it's indeed her.
Devote your life to me.
Episode 1 "I Got a Girlfriend!"
I wanna squeeze some boobs.
I agree with Hyoudou Issei-kun!
Stop saying that. You're making me feel empty.
Matsuda, Motohama,
why did we enroll in this school?
This private school, Kuou Academy, just turned coed after being an all-girls school.
Thus, the school has an overwhelming girls to boys ratio,
and many beautiful girls from overseas are attending it!
Which makes us boys valuable.
That means, we'll be popular without having to lift a finger!
You basically can't mess up!
In short, we'll get a harem!
Yes, a successful life full of real boobs awaits us!
Fight on! Fight on!
Or so we thought.
It's spring, we're in the second year,
and we still haven't had a single girlfriend.
Stop saying that. You're making me feel empty.
You lose the moment you give up!
We still have a chance!
Kiba-kun!
What do you have next?
Hey, how about going to karaoke with us?
Sorry, but I have club activities now.
That's too bad!
Thanks for inviting me, though. I'm really sorry.
Kiba Yuuto of Class 2-C.
He's an idol to all the girls in the school...
...and the enemy of all boys, us included!
Damn it!
It's ridiculous how he's getting all the girls just because
he's a little handsome, pretty smart, and good-natured!
Stop saying that. You're making me feel empty.
It's such an unfair world.
Oh, it's almost time!
Where are you going?
Murayama's boobs are so big!
She's 82-70-81.
Katase has great legs!
She's 78.5-65-79.
I miraculously found this spot during PE!
Hey!
Let me see too!
Don't hog it all to yourselves!
Damn you!
Is someone outside?
You...!
What the hell?
Hey, Matsuda, Motoha...ma...
You again?
This is bad.
W-Wait.
Hyoudou, you pervert!
They seriously hit me with their bamboo swords.
Unlucky for you, Issei.
You left me behind!
I wouldn't complain if I had at least seen some boobs,
but I wasn't even looking and they still—
So, there are actually people in the old schoolhouse, huh?
That red hair is so nice.
Rias Grimoire.
She's 99-58-90
and has been the president of the occult
research club for three years running.
Rumor says her family comes from Northern Europe.
That kid just now...
Sorry?
I mean the kid in the middle.
He's in class 2-B. If I recall correctly, his name is Hyoudou.
What about that boy?
Never mind. I was probably just seeing things.
Checkmate.
Oh my.
It was an easy problem.
I did raise the difficulty quite a bit, though.
You did?
I hope the next one will be harder.
My school life's so bleak.
Will my time at the academy be wasted without a single chance to get some boobs in my hands?
U-Um...
You're Hyoudou Issei-kun of Kuou Academy,
aren't you?
Yes?
I've never seen that uniform before.
I wonder what school she's from.
She's so cute!
Um...
C-Can I help you?
Well...
Hyoudou-kun, are you seeing anyone at the moment?
N-Not really.
I'm glad to hear that!
Huh?
U-Um, would you mind going out with me?
What did you say just now?
I've always seen you pass by here and... well...
I knew you were my...
H-Hey, is this...?
P-Please...
Please go out with me!
A-Are you serious!?
Wake up. Wake up!
I-If you don't wake up, I-I'll kiss you!
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake—
Wh-What!?
Why!?
This is Amano Yuuma-chan.
These are my friends, Matsuda and Motohama.
Nice to meet you.
And she's my...
girlfriend.
Well, you guys should get one soon too!
Let's go, Yuuma-chan.
Okay!
Th-That traitor!
A date?
Yeah, this coming Sunday. Or is that a bad time?
N-Not at all! Of course it's fine!
That's great!
See you.
All right! See you later.
I'm looking forward to our date!
Yeah, me too.
A date, a date!
It has such a nice ring to it!
Awesome!
I see.
As expected, your intuition...
...was right on the money, hm?
I made the correct choice by having you watch him.
President, what would you like to do?
I'll make some preliminary preparations,
but in the end, it all depends on him.
She's late.
Please check us out!
I didn't mean to take one.
We grant
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hyour wish.
"We grant your wish"?
That sounds like a scam.
Issei-kun!
Good morning, Yuuma-chan!
Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?
Oh no, I just got here.
I always wanted to say that!
If I hear the
Way in the
morning I am
content even
to die in
that evening.
If I hear the
Way in the
morning I am
content even
to die in
that evening.
What's the matter?
Are you all right?
We had a lot of fun today!
Yeah, it was a great day!
Th-This is my big chance.
I did it!
Say, Issei-kun.
Do you mind doing me one favor
to commemorate our first date?
C-Could she be asking for a ki...
Wh-What kind of favor?
Could you die, please?
What?
Wait, you...
Huh?
Sorry, Yuuma-chan. Can you repeat that?
I think there's something wrong with my ears.
Could you die, please?
I see them!
I definitely saw them!
It was only for an instant, but I saw real boobs!
I've seen my first real-life boobs!
And such a cute girl's, too!
Isn't this what people call an exhibition?
No, not that.
This isn't the time for that.
Wings?
Although short-lived, playing innocent
lovey-dovey with you was fun.
I'll take good care of this gift from you.
So...
Yuuma-chan?
...please die.
Sorry, your existence posed a threat to us.
So we took the initiative and moved in for the kill.
Blame God for planting Sacred Gear inside your body.
Sac... What?
Thanks for the wonderful memories.
Seriously?
I'm going to die in this tiny, little park because
of the bizarre thing that just happened?
If you were going to kill me, you could've
at least let me squeeze your boobs.
I could only catch a glance, but Yuuma-chan had great boobs.
It's red.
Red, just like the color of her hair.
It's red.
Her hair is more crimson than strawberry blonde;
the same color is coating my hands.
What am I saying?
I'm about to die.
It's hopeless. Damn it.
I can't move my body at all.
I don't even know why I have to die.
But really, I lived such a crappy life.
If I could be born again, I... I...
Rias-senpai... Her alluring red hair...
If I'm to die anyway, I want to die in
the breasts of a beautiful girl like her.
You called me, didn't you?
Wh-Who's that?
If you're dying anyway, I'll take you.
Wings again.
You will...
devote your life to me.
Wake up or I'll kill you.
Wake up if you don't want to be killed.
Wake—
I feel so heavy.
This thing gave me such a weird dream.
A dream?
You really don't remember Yuuma-chan?
I told you I don't know a girl with that name!
As we said, you never introduced a girl like that to us,
and there's just no way you got a girlfriend!
It's just not possible!
I have her mail address right he—
I don't!
Yuuma-chan's phone number and address...
are both gone.
Rias-senpai!
Really?
It's Rias-senpai!
She's as wonderful as always.
She's so beautiful!
Typhoon Lick!
Oh, that looks better!
Doesn't it?
Amazing riding action as expected from the Rider!
Hey, they're not off.
Huh? What did you say?
The lights aren't off.
What?
What the hell are you talking about?
No, that's not it.
The lights are off.
I don't sense light.
But I can see it.
I'm seeing it.
Sorry.
I'm going home.
What, you feeling ill or something?
I can see more clearly than I could during the day.
And, for some reason, I feel like there's a
kind of power flowing through my body.
No, buy me one!
I'll leave you here if you keep whining!
No!
How can I hear things from that far away!?
What happened to me?
My body is acting strangely.
This park...
Yeah, it was right here.
I was here with Yuuma-chan on a date.
Yuuma-chan...
I don't want to believe that was a dream.
What was that?
How unfortunate.
It might just be my lucky day to meet your kind in such a place.
What's going on? I can't stop trembling.
I was going to step back just a little!
Running away?
I have no idea what's happening!
Feathers?
Yuuma-chan?
This is why low-level creatures are so troublesome.
A-Am I dreaming again?
I cannot sense the presence of either a master or mate.
You don't try to escape nor are you expanding a magic circle.
Analysis of the situation suggests you must be a stray.
Then I can just kill you.
If I had to dream again, I would've liked a beautiful
girl a billion times better than a guy like that!
It hurts.
It seriously hurts.
It wasn't this bad when Yuuma-chan...
It hurts, doesn't it?
Light is a deadly poison to your species, after all.
I thought that would finish you off, but you're quite resilient.
Worry not. I will put you to rest soon.
It's hopeless now.
Someone... help me!
Did you do that?
Guess not.
Don't lay a finger on that kid.
Red hair...
R-Rias-senpai...
Who the hell are you?
Damn you!
Red hair... I see.
You must be from the Grimoire family.
I'm Rias Grimoire. How are you today, my dear fallen angel?
Oh, wow. Who knew this was the jurisdiction
of the Grimoire family's heiress apparent?
Is he of your household?
I will not show mercy if you mess with him.
Well, I apologize for today,
but you'd better not let your menservants run free.
Someone like me might just hunt them
down during his walk, you know?
Thank you for the most helpful advice.
Then let me give you a warning too: I will not let you
off scot free should you do something like this again.
Same to you, heiress apparent of the Grimoire family.
My name is Donner Sik.
Hope we never face each other again.
I was careless. Who knew he'd come
into contact with a fallen angel?
He'll die at this rate.
I won't let him die.
After all, he's my...
Master, please wake up!
Master—
I feel so heavy.
I had a weird dream again.
Why is this happening night after—
Huh? Why am I naked?
Where's my underwear?
Rias-senpai!?
It's morning?
B-Boobs!
Good morning.
U-Um, Rias-senpai, wh-why are you...?
Wait, is this a dream?
Right, I'm still dreaming!
Everything you experienced was real.
I am Rias Grimoire,
a demon.
A-A demon?
And your master.
Nice to have you, Hyoudou Issei-kun.

Next Episode
Please think of what would be your most intense feeling.
I will become the Harem King!
Give me power!
I Quit Being a Human!
Well, I got myself a silly little brother.﻿Issei, wake up!
You're going to be late.
Issei.
I’ll get up!
I’ll be downstairs in a second!
You say that every morning!
I told you that you don’t need to come up here!
I'm just taking...
Just how long are you going to stay in bed?
Good morning.
Good Morning.
P-Please get ready quickly.
F-Father!!!
Mother, what’s wrong?!
Was there a random lady in our son’s room?!
A foreigner! A... A... A real person!
Calm down!
Tell me what happened?
Brea...breas...
Hear me out here!  She had red hair! It’s international!
How am I going to explain this?
Rather why are Rias-senpai and I in bed together?
I don’t remember anything.
I can't remember a damn thing!
Why?
Remember the most important part, me!
Is this how I lose my virginity?
Remember!
Remember the best parts, damn it!
What a lively household, so early in the morning.
Umm, I can see them~!
See what?
Like your breasts and such.
If you want to look, go ahead.
Did you just say, ”Go ahead”?
I didn’t even realize those words existed!
Now, don’t mind if I do...
Ah, is your stomach alright?
Huh?
Where you were stabbed.
Stabbed...
W-Why does this woman know about my dream?
It wasn’t a dream.
You know, your body is surprisingly strong.
It was a fatal wound. Yet, you were cured overnight.
”Cured”?
Because your body had been weakened, I applied magic to cure you.
Hey,
can you hook this for me?
G-Gladly!
More importantly, Senpai, why am I dressed like this?
I told you already, didn’t I?
I had to apply magic to heal you,
while hugging you naked.
H-Hugging nake-?!
Don’t you worry,
I’m still a virgin.
Vir-?!
Er, i-is that so?
Wait, why am I relieved over this?
Don’t make a face like that.
There are many mysteries within this world.
Mysteries...?
Um, Rias-senpai?
What is it?
You were saying earlier about devils and such?
That’s right.
I’m a devil.
I am your master...
until the day you die.

The 2nd story ｢ I Stopped Being a Human ｣
N-No way!
I can’t believe this guy!
Of all people, him?!
R-Rias Onee-sama...
I guess it’s to be expected...
After all, the school’s most popular, number one idol, Rias Gremory is standing next to me.
I’ll send you a messenger later.
Messenger?
Let’s meet up again after school.
W-Wait, Rias-senpai!
Wait, hold up!
What the hell is your problem,
traitor?!
Weren’t we supposed to be brothers until the end?!
Calm down, Matsuda.
Motohama?!
To start off, let’s hear your story, Issei.
The hell happened after you left our house yesterday?!
Matsuda, Motohama.
What is it, Issei?
Have you guys ever, you know, actually seen breasts?
I don’t know!
I’ve never
seen it before!
Is that boy the one?
Good day to you, Rias.
Good day to you as well, Souna.
It’s not like you to let someone...
into your family so hastily.
Is that so?
Well, I can say I’ve elicited a silly young brother.
Rock, paper, scissor, shoot!
I see.
She said she’d send a messenger, but no one came in the end.
Hey.
Kiba-kun!!!
Psh, Prince Charming. Go die in a fire.
If you’ll excuse me for a moment.
Of course!
The room is a bit messy, but please!
Good day. How are you?
What is it?
I’ve come as a messenger from Rias Gremory.
Wait, so you’re...?
Could you please follow me?
No way! Kiba-kun and Pervy-Lecher walking together?!
You’ll be tainted, Kiba-kun!
Why is Kiba-kun talking to that thing?
I don’t get what the hell is going on.
W-What is this room?
T-This girl is...!
She’s a freshman. Toujo Koneko-san.
This person over here is Hyoudou Issei-kun.
H-How do you do?
A short, petite body. An un-defeatable loli-face.
Someone who’s not only popular with men, but also with women! A mascot character!
It’s Toujo Koneko-chan!
To have thought that she was part of the Occult Research Club!
What a pleasant surprise!
A shower? In the club room?
This...
This is art! Just saying “art” won’t suffice! Look at those lines!
Prez, the one you summoned for is here.
hank you, Akeno.
Rias-senpai?! It’s just as I had thought!
What a beautiful club room!
What a lewd face.
Oh my.
Oh my, oh my.
So you’re the new club member, correct?
Pleased to meet you.
I’m the vice-president, Himejima Akeno.
Please, make yourself at home.
I-I’m Hyoudou Issei.
Nice to meet you.
This one is of an endangered species, the brunette ponytails!
An embodiment of the ideal wife, she stands next to Rias-senpai
as the school’s two Onee-samas, Hamejima Akeno-senpai!!!
What a beautiful club this is!!!
I’m terribly sorry.
I hadn’t had a chance to shower since last night.
Please, no need to apologize.
Now everyone’s here!
We at the Occult Research Club welcome you!
I-I see.
However, the Occult Research Club is just a guise.
It’s more like just a hobby.
What exactly do you mean?
I’ll quit beating around the bushes.
We’re all devils.
That’s awfully frank of you.
The man last night with the black wings,
he’s a fallen angel.
A being once having served god,
they were outcast and abandoned...
after being tainted by evil.
These beings manipulate humans...
and try to exterminate us demons.
They meander about the realm of the dead,
or as humans say, Hell.
Aside from these, there are also normal servants of God...
who come and try to defeat us.
In other words, there are three parties in a free-for-all.
Have you understood everything thus far?
Well, how do I say this? It’s rather complicated for a normal high school boy like me.
Amano Yuuma.
Surely you haven’t forgotten her.
You even dated her.
I don’t know where or how you heard that name,
but I don’t feel comfortable talking about her in this club.
I’m sorry, but-
Yuuma-chan?!
This woman did exist...
for certain.
High School
DxD
Hadena Fansubs
This is the girl, Amano Yuuma-chan, correct?
C-Correct.
But, how did you...?
This woma- No, thing, is a fallen angel.
The very same type of being as the things that assaulted you last night.
But Matsudo nor Motohama remembered this girl!
Even her phone number wasn’t on my phone!
She used her powers.
Just like I did with your parents.
A-A senpai who’s close to her kouhai?
B-But you two were in bed together, naked.
Oh, those are the norms nowadays, Mother, Father.
You can’t be seriously-
Oh, I didn’t know.
Well, I guess it can’t be helped, then.
Wait, since when were my parents so gullible?
...was what I was thinking, but...
Since the fallen angel had accomplished its task,
it proceeded to remove herself from your life and memory of others.
Its task?
To kill you.
She had wanted to check if you possessed one of the treasures.
Once she had confirmed it, she decided to kill you.
More specifically, she impaled you with a spear of light.
If you’re going to hate, hate the God that put you in possession of one of the Sacred Gear.
I remember now. At the time, Yuuma-chan had said something about some Sac-
Sacred Gear.
A power given to a special group of people.
They say many of those who remain known in history have possessed one of these Sacred Gears.
Occasionally, a Sacred Gear powerful enough to invoke the presence of demons and fallen angels also appear.
Issei, could you raise your left hand above you?
L-Like this?
I want you to close your eyes and think of something you feel most passionate about.
T-This is all so sudden...
Focus, Issei.
O-Okay!
Focus. Focus!
That's right, Issei.
Focus.
Focus... Focus...
Focus...
Foc-
There's no way I can keep doing this!
It's fine. It seems to be a bit difficult at the moment.
Because of the nice panchira you're giving me, my focus is being diverted elsewhere!
But, are you sure that there isn't a mistake here?
It's an undeniable fact that the fallen angels attacked you with the Gear in mind.
But, if that were a fact, isn't it strange that I'm still alive?
That's because of this.
wish you want.
I will grant any
That's...?
When you were breathing your last moments.
Through this card, you summoned me to your presence.
Now that she mentions it, I did remember Rias-senpai's flaming red hair...
Issei,
you were reborn as my family member, Rias Gremory,
daughter of the Gremory marquis. To be more precise,
you were born as my servant.
It seems like I can see better at night.
All this talk about demons and servants, I had thought it was all a muse.
To have thought it was all real.
That's right, we're all devils as well.
I look forward to working with you.
Are you for real?
I'm a devil?
Are you telling me that I quit being a human?!
Devils make contracts with humans.
Then, the devils instill within the human, powers.
Nowadays, there are barely any magicians who work on exterminating us devils.
Thus, we usually hop onto any chance we get when we’re summoned by someone.
I-I see.
Usually, I make my familiar do this work,
but this is just to let you learn all the ropes from servant to devil.
You should work hard. You might one day own a servant of your own.
My own servant?!
It’d all depend on your own effort, of course.
If it’s my servant, then they can’t object to anything I tell them to do, right?!
Yeah.
I can do anything I want, right?!
Of course.
E-Even... perverted things?!
If it’s your own servant, I don’t see why not.
Since I have no hope of becoming a human again...
I’m going to become a harem king!!!
Yahoooooooo!
I’ve finished my errand!
Issei, I have another job for you today.
Koneko got two summoning requests today.
I’m going to leave one of them to you.
Thank you for the help.
Please, don’t mention it.
Wait, so does this mean I can get a contract?
This is an outline of a Summoning Grid.
Issei, put out your left hand.
Yes.
This is a seal.
It represents the Gremory family.
Once you get to your destination, just do as I told you to.
You do remember, right?
O-Of course!
What a nice response.
Now, go on!
Got it!
All right! Picking up my first contract!
Huh?
Oh my!
Issei.
Yes?
It seems you can’t teleport.
Shit, what demon in the world has to ride a bicycle to their destination?!
Sunset Apartments. This seems like the place.
Good day, Morisawa-san.
I’m here under orders from the Gremory demons.
Oh, hello.
I want a replacement.
B-But you’re the one...
who summoned me!
What demon in the world arrives by knocking on the front door?
He’s standing right in front of your door.
Cut the crap.
Koneko-chan always comes out of this Summoning Grid.
Besides, I summoned Koneko-chan. Not you.
Go home.
If I could have, I would have come through that Summoning Grid!
Why the hell would I just bike  through the night for no reason?!
You’re hopeless...
Oh, thank you.
So you’re a devil. You have some speciality, don’t you?
Show me it.
Well, not really...
Rather, what kind of “speciality” does Koneko-chan have...?
Oh.
She cosplays and we bride carry!
Wh-Why the hell does that have to be with a devil?!
Can you even imagine a young girl like her other than a devil doing bride carrying me?!
Well, you do have a point there...
Wait, carrying him?
So, what’s your speciality?
Oh, right.
Dragon...
...Rush!!!
Sorry,
I actually can’t do anything yet.
”Dragon and Ball,” I see.
Your master’d be one of the “pass-me-down” types.
I’m more of “straight to the goods” type.
Observe!
All of these are first edition books!
S-So what if you’re a, “straight to the goods” type?!
What?!
I have the entire collection as a limited prize edition!
You don’t seem to understand.
Every Wednesday after broadcast,
in order to create the ultimate Bravery Ball, accompanied...
by my comrades, we live days of extreme bravery in an attempt to gather the bravery required!
Even I’ve passed my days while playing bad games...
of hide-and-seek to accomplish my tasks!
I still believe that the main character, Grandson of the Sky Sasaru, will surely prevail as the strongest!
I on the other hand believe Beru is the strongest!!!
I suppose that’s not a totally impossible choice.
Right?!
I suppose that’s not a totally impossible choice.
Shall we?
We shall.
Bah, I couldn’t get a contract and ended up intensely reading Dragon and Ball.
What the hell am I doing?
This is feeling... She’s the same as...
Well this is strange.
You don’t seem to be a different person either.
After all, I had ordered for you to be killed.
This is truly strange.
Eh!
It can’t be...?
Why the hell are you alive?
A fallen angel?!
That person was supposed to have killed you!
A member of the Gremorys?
Shit...
What, am I going to be killed again?
So you’re the one that Donashiku mistook as a stray.
I didn’t think you’d have already become a part of the Gremorys.
But, that’s just all the more fun for me!
I’m going to be killed by this person!
No... I need power... I need the power to defeat this person!
Think of something you feel most passionate about.
I still believe that the main character, Grandson of the Sky Sasaru, will surely prevail as the strongest!
I want you to think up of that thought.
Dragon rush!
Give me...
Give me the power!!!
S-Sacred Gear?!
It appears I’ll have to kill that person before I can kill you!
Sacred... Gear?
Yes
That’s one of the Sacred Gears.
Once activated, you can invoke its powers at will.
I was getting worried about what would happen if it didn’t go away.
Amazing, Issei-kun!
D-Do you think so?
Though this is slightly troublesome.
The fallen angels now know that you’ve been revived...
and become a demon.
I’m sorry.
It can’t be helped since your encounter with the fallen angels was an accident.
But, don’t ever get too full of yourself and start fighting them on your own.
Understood. Prez,
I’m going to go home now.
Prez, perhaps you said too much?
He is a novice, after all.
All the more reason to be strict.
I need to make sure that he knows.
Right.
Like hell I’m going to let those fallen angels take my cute servant away.
Onii-chan,
hurry up and wake up!
It’s morning!
If you don’t wake up, I’ll tickle you!
I really messed up last night.
What will I do if Prez is still angry?
Ah, shoot.
Oh, why do I keep tripping?
W-Who?

I’m sort of lost and having trouble.
For now, make sure you observe what a “devil’s fight” is.

Boom!
Don't betray my expectations.﻿Whoa! A blonde with gleaming panties!
This is rare! It's my lucky day!
Wait, I shouldn't be saying that.
A-Are you okay?
Thank you very much.
She's cute...
U-Um...
S-Sorry!
She's the embodiment of my dream girl!
A beautiful blonde!
Thank you very much.
Oh, it was nothing.
I just need to keep up the conversation. Subjects, subjects...
Today's weather sure is nice, isn't it?
What the hell am I? The neighborhood grandma?!
Actually, um...
Eh?
I've actually lost my way.

The 3rd story ｢I Made New Friends!｣
Are you on a trip?
No,
I've actually been transferred to this town's Church.
So you're a Sister?
That'd explain your outfit.
I'm glad I was able to meet someone as nice as you.
This must be the Lord's doing.
Is something the matter?
No, it's nothing.
Why am I suddenly...
Um!
A boy shouldn't cry over something like this.
H-His cut is...
Huh? My hand was throbbing just now.
Here you go, your cut is gone.
You're all better now.
My apologies.
I instinctively...
My left hand reacted.
Meaning...
I'm sure you were startled.
Oh no, it's fine.
You have a really nice power.
It's an amazing power given to me by God.
Yes,
an amazing...
Oh, is that it?
Oh, yeah.
If you're talking about churches, that'd be the only one.
Thank goodness. I'm really owe you one!
T-Though, I've never seen anyone there.
I'd really like to thank you properly.
Could you please come with me?
I'd love to, but I have things I need to attend to.
I see.
Well, my name is Asia Argento.
Please, call me Asia.
My name is Hyoudou Issei.
Just "Issei" is fine.
Issei-san,
I'm glad that I was able to meet someone so kind and caring
such as yourself, so quickly after coming to Japan.
Oh, thank you.
Please, if you ever have the time, come visit me at the church.
It's a promise, okay?
All right. It's a promise.
I'll see you around, then.
Okay! I pray that we meet again.
She's really a nice girl.
I don't want you ever going near a church again.
The church, to us, is the enemy's territory.
Even entering a church will cause problems with the God and Devils.
For all you know, you could have had a holy spear thrown at you.
Really?
So those chills I get when I'm near a church...
Your instincts as a devil were reacting.
Even the fact that you were standing by a being of the church, was dangerous.
There are even exorcists who possess a Sacred Gear within the church.
Issei.
Y-Yes?
A devil who's been exorcised, would cease to exist.
You wouldn't leave a trace.
You won't feel a thing.
You won't be able to resist.
Do you realize how serious this is?
Sorry, I didn't...
Sorry. I overreacted.
Anyway, please be careful from now on.
Okay.
Feels like Prez has only been scolding me.
Sorry, Asia.
I don't think I'll be able to keep my promise.
Prez is only worried about you, Issei-kun.
A-Akeno-san?!
Akeno? I thought you'd gone home already.
I came back a minute ago. I received an urgent message.
Its content?
It appears that a stray devil has been spotted in town.
It probably used to be a servant.
Someone like us?
There are those who either defect or try to kill their masters and live their own lives.
These devils are called stray devils.
Reports say that this stray devil is further along here; apparently she ate the human she killed.
S-She what?
Taking care of this will be our job for the night.
Mindlessly abusing your power as a devil only leads to ugly repercussions.
Issei.
Y-Yes, Prez?
Do you know how to play chess?
Do you mean that board game?
The master, me, is the king.
The other master, the queen.
The horseman, the knight.
The warrior, the rook.
The holy man, the bishop.
The private, the pawn.
A master who acquires his or her own servant assigns
one of these roles to each and every one of them.
Characteristics of the pieces?
We like to call these evil pieces.
Why the trouble?
For tonight, I'd like you to observe a real devil's fight.
O-Okay.
It's here.
What a disgusting smell.
But, I also smell something succulent.
I wonder if it tastes sweet.
I wonder if it tastes bitter?
B-Breasts!
Stray devil, Weissa.
Ran from her master's dwelling and causes mayhem at will.
She's an insubordinate being.
We'll make certain to punish her sins with death.
I, a Gremory, vow to this!
I'll make you suffer!
How cute, missy.
How about I make everyone's body that bright red color of your hair?!
You seem to know only how to repeat what you hear.
This is a stray devil?
Only looks like a beautiful woman to me!
I told you before.
It's entire being only consists corruption.
She has such nice breasts! What a waste!
Is she some kind magician?!
T-That's most certainly a monster.
You mustn't let your guard down.
Yuuto!
He disappeared?!
He's simply too fast to see.
Yuuto's role is the knight.
His forte is his speed with his weapon being the sword.
Watch out, Koneko-chan!
It's fine.
Her role is the rook.
Her specialty is simple.
She has pure, unmatched physical strength.
Something like that won't even make her flinch.
How annoying.
I'll keep in mind not to mess with Koneko-chan.
Akeno.
Of course, Prez.
My, oh my. How shall I go about this?
Prez!
Sacred Gear!!
T-Thank you.
No problem.
My body seemed to just move on its own.
Huh?
Akeno, finish it off.
I'll have to give proper punishment for anything that dare lay its hands on Prez.
Her role is the queen.
She has the powers of all the other pieces, combined.
She's the Invincible Vise Prez.
Oh my, you seem just full of energy.
I hope you'll enjoy this!
She has the power to use powerful magic. On top of that...
Oh my, you're still energetic?
... she's the ultimate...
... example of a sadist.
Just how much more can you take?
S-She's laughing...
Akeno, you can stop there for today.
Aw, so quickly?
How unfortunate.
Any last words?
Screw you.
I see. Well, why don't you disappear for us?
Checkmate.
It's over.
Now,
let's all go home!
Okay, Prez.
U-Um,
Prez?
What is it?
Well,
what am I?
I mean, what role do I play? You know, as your servant.
You're a pawn.
Wait, that means...
That's right.
You're just a private.
Private...
Wait, that's the least valuable piece!!
High School
DxD
Hadena Fansubs
In order to acquire servants, you need to become a master.
Unlike those who are born as a master,
we converts must fight and prove our worthiness.
But, I'm a private.
The worst piece.
I'm just a replaceable placeholder.
Ah, looks like my path to being a harem king is a long, winding road.
It's rather dangerous of them to keep the door unlocked.
Hello? I'm a devil under the name of Gremory!
Could the client come out?
I just felt something repulsive...
Is anyone home?
We received two requests for Koneko-chan again.
Could you handle one of them for tonight?
Of course, Prez.
Make certain that you acquire the contract this time.
Don't betray my expectations.
U-Understood.
If I just went home at this rate, I won't even be able to look Prez in the eye.
I'm coming in!
They even set up the mood.
Hello?
There's something on the floo-
This is...
The hell is this...
"He who sins is punished."
I borrowed those words off of a certain holy figure.
And carried them out.
Who do we have here?
A devil of the Gremorys?
My name is Freed Serzen.
I'm a young Catholic priest working with some church.
P-Priest?
In any case, I at least know that I'm not some rotten devil like you.
You did this?
You've ended your life as a human as soon as you contact a devil.
It's ended! Ended!
And that's why I killed him!
Killing a shit human who contacted a shit devil for shitty reasons...
...is my job, after all.
A holy sword?
I'll be shoving this blade into that heart of yours,
as well as putting a bullet with love into your brain!
Hope you're ready!
Die!
It's a specially made exorcist's golden bullet.
How do you like it?
You bastard!
Oh, so you actually are a devil!
Perfect, I can actually get into the mood to kill devils, then!
Sorry!
Hey, hey. Dying already?
Those types of devils piss me off the most.
Oh my, is this my assistant, Asia-chan?
Are you done putting up that barrier?
T-This is...
Oh, I get it. You're a beginner!
This is our job.
We clean up those filthy humans who deal with devils.
T-That's-
Ah!
Issei-san?
Asia...
What's this? Do you two know each other?
Why are you...
I'm sorry...
I'm... a devil.
Issei-san, you're... a devil?
I wasn't tricking you!
Even though, I decided that it be best if we...
never met again...
No...
Sorry, Asia-chan. But humans and devils can't be together.
After all, we fallen angels can't live without the blessings of the Holy Lord.
We're all a bunch of deficient beings, really.
Fallen angels?
Now, I think I'll quickly clean up this work that's left over.
Are you ready? Well, too bad. I won't wait for-
Asia?
Hey, hey. Are you serious?
Father Freed, I ask of you.
Please forgive this man!
Please, spare him his life!
Do you...
realize what you're trying to do right now?
Even if he is a devil, Issei-san is a kind gentleman!
Even in retrospect, there's no way the Lord would forgive something like this!
What?!
What the hell are you on about?!
Asia!
You damn whore, you sure you don't have a damn cross lodged in your brain?
Asia!
I've been told not to hurt a female fallen angel,
but I feel like some punishment is due here.
Asia!!
Isn't it just a bit ironic that a holy sister is about to be seriously violated
by a priest, of all people?
No!!
Stop it!
I'll have to ask you to sit down, Mr. Customer.
Let go of... Asia!
Are you serious?
Are you going to fight me?
You're going to die a horrible, suffering death!
Issei-san, you mustn't!
I probably can't win this.
Hell, I might even die.
But, there's no way I can run away in front of the girl...
that stood up for me!
Right!
It hurt!
Interesting.
Would you like to set the new record for the most badly beaten up man?
A magic square?!
Kiba?!
Hyoudou-kun.
We've come to save you.
Oh my. This is rather bad.
An exorcist.
Everyone...
The devil squad is here!
Sorry,
but that man is part of us.
Oh, I like that.
TL Note: Seme and Uke refer to a ship and bay respectively in a homosexual relationship.
Are you the seme and he the uke?
It's hard to believe that you're a priest with that foul mouth of yours.
Don't be so annoying, you piece of shit devil.
Killing things like you is the joy in life!
Can't you just hurry up and die for me?
Devils can pick their prey too, you know.
Wonderful! I love the enthusiasm!
Is this love? Infatuation?
I can't get enough of this mood for killing...
Then why don't you let us kill you?
It seems like you affectionately...
cared for my precious servant.
Prez!
What's this? A challenger approaches?
Oh yes. I cared for him quite well. Is that a problem?
Are you okay, Issei?
I'm sorry. Even though I was just scolded.
Yet, I do something like this again...
You're hurt this badly.
I'm sorry.
We didn't realize a stray exorcist was also around.
A barrier was up until just now so we didn't realize.
What the hell are you on about, bitch?
The barrier is your goddamn job!!
Asia!
I don't forgive anyone who...
harms their own servant.
Especially the vulgar, rude and inconsiderate types like you.
I really can't hold back...
when I see someone like you.
Well, this might be getting bad.
Actually, this is fairly bad.
There are multiple fallen angels.
The tables have turned on you guys!!
Why don't you stick around for the party?!
Prez?
Recovering Issei is our top priority for now.
Akeno, prepare for the jump.
Yes.
Koneko, I'll leave Issei to you.
Yes.
You damn demons, you think I'm going to let you-
Ow, ow! It hurt!
Prez,
that girl as well!
Unfortunately, only those within our family can use this.
N-No...
Asia!!
Let me go! I have to save Asia!!
Let me go!!
Asia!!
Issei-san.
We'll surely,
We'll surely, one day,
meet again.
Asia!!

Why can't you quietly disappear?
Thanks so much for coming out to greet me like this.
Yes. This meeting is...
today's special...
The 4th story ｢ I'll Save My Friend! ｣
What are you going to do if you can't even save your friends?!﻿Y-yeah.
Did Prez do this to me last time I died, too?
There you go.
T-Thanks.
It seems recovery will take some time.
The Holy power that stray exorcist used was rather powerful.
So, devils aren't the only ones that can go astray.
There are many servants among the church who also go astray.
So, you're telling me that, Asia is a fallen exorcist?
Regardless of what it is, you're a devil and she's an exorcist.
that's the truth.
Prez...
I'm weak.
I'm way too weak.
I'm nothing but a pawn.
I couldn't even save one girl.
Issei-san.
Like hell I'm weak!
I'll just train and get stronger!
Looks like, it's no use.
No, she's stuck with that perverted priest.
Who knows what is he doing to her now.
Issei-san?
Asia?

The 4th story ｢I'll Save My Friend!｣
Um, Asia-chan?
Y-Yes?
This is how you eat these!
I never knew such an amazing method to eat these existed.
It's delicious!
Come to think of it, why were you at the park?
It's just that I had free time, so I was taking a walk around town.
And while I was doing so, I saw you so...
Asia.
yeah?{bad position
Let's have a lot of fun today!
What's up?
N-Nothing.
Do you like Racchu-kun?
Uh...no...well...yeah.
I may not look like a gamer,
but I used to play these games at the local arcade all the time.
Thank you so much!
I'll treasure this as a symbol of our friendship!
Where do you want to go next?
Yes. Our meeting signifies a special occasion.
This is the first time in a long time that I've had so much fun.
Jeez, Asia, you exaggerate too much.
Ouch!
A-Asia?
This must be the wound from the other day.
Man, she's cute.
Your legs were injured too, correct?
Are you okay?
Wow! I can move everything!
My legs feel better now!
Amazing! You're amazing, Asia!
As a child, I was abandoned by my parents.
They left me at a church in a small European village.
That's where I was found crying. I grew up there.
When I was seven, a dying puppy wandered into the church.
I constantly prayed.
That was when a miracle happened.
Soon after, I was taken to a larger church and asked to heal people from all over the world.
I was so happy that my gift was able to help so many.
One day, I saw an injured man lying on the floor.
But, this man was...
You're using your power to heal evil!
You blasted witch!
Those who possess power to also heal evil were banished.
And so you, without a home, became a fallen angel.
Yet, I've never neglected thanking and praying to God for this gift.
I never knew what those individuals were doing.
I'm sure this is the Lord's will.
I believe that this is a test of my will to persevere.
One day, the Lord will surely reward me by granting me my dream.
Dream?
That I'll make many friends. We'll go buy flowers and books, or talk about things.
That's my dream.
Right now, I have no friends.
Issei-san?
I'll become your friend.
But, aren't we already friends?
We already played and talked. Well, we didn't buy flowers and books, though.
Isn't that enough?
No, no! It's definitely enough!
I just fear, that I'll be an inconvenience.
It doesn't matter whether I'm a devil or you're a sister. Friends are friends.
I'm...
I'm so...
I'm so happy!
Sorry, but that's not happening.
Yuuma?
Reinare-sama?
So, she really was a fallen angel.
So what I heard about you degrading your self to be with a devil and living a pitiful life, is true.
Asia, it's pointless to run.
I will not go back! I cannot return to a place with the intention of hurting others!
I'm really sorry. I actually ran away from that church.
I figured that out a while ago.
There's no possible way you'd be associated with these pathetic fools.
What is your business, fallen angel?
Will you please refrain from talking to me.
You're a worthless piece of filth that belongs elsewhere.
If you're going to interfere...
A holy weapon?
I'm not holding back this time.
Sacred Gear!!
I did it!
I was wondering what you had, but it's just a Zuweiss Critical.
What a letdown.
Zuweiss Critical?
Also known as "Dragon's Hand"
It does nothing but double your power for a short amount of time. It's useless.
Double...?
I heard your Sacred Gear was dangerous,
so I went through the trouble of acting to get close to you.
"P-Please go out with me!"
Your jaws hit the floor when I asked that!
Shut it. Shut the hell up!
Something so insignificant won't have a chance against me!
Why don't you just quietly hand Asia over to me?
No!
Issei-san!
What good am I if I can't even save my friend?!
Work! You'll double my power, right?!
Yes sir!
The power! It's flowing in!
Issei-san!
Issei-san!!
Do you understand? Even if one becomes two, it changes nothing.
Shit...
Asia?
Are you okay?
Amazing, my pain is fading away.
Asia, why don't you come back with me quietly?
Your Twilight Healing puts his Sacred Gear to shame.
So, all you really wanted was my power?
If you quietly come back, I won't kill that devil.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Why should anyone listen to what the hell you say?!
Asia, watch out!
Issei-san!
Her power is nothing like before...
I missed on purpose that time.
If I'd landed that shot, his body would be in pieces right now.
I wonder if your healing will make it in time?
I'll go with you.
What a good girl.
If the ritual goes well, all your pains and worries will simply disappear.
Good bye, Issei-kun.
No! Asia!!
Good bye, Issei-san.
Why? Why am I so weak?!

How many times must I tell you?
No, means no.
Forget about that girl already.
You're a part of the Gremory family.
Then remove me from your family.
That way, I can try to save her on my own.
Do you really think that's possible?
Aren't I just a pawn in this game of chess?
Why does it matter if a pawn disappears?
Be quiet!
Do you think that because you're a pawn, you're the weakest piece?
I believe I've told you before, that with these Evil Pieces, the rules are literal.
The pawn's speciality is...
Promotion.
If a pawn is able to move to the other side of the board,
it can become any piece other than a king.
Are you telling me that I can possess the power of other pieces?
Only, in the case I accept a certain location as the, "other side of the board."
For example, the church.
Also keep in mind your Sacred Gear.
It can double my power, right?
I heard it from the fallen angel.
Keep in mind,
that a Sacred Gear is activated by the owner's will.
The stronger the will, the stronger the gear reacts.
The strength of my will?
We have a situation. Akeno and I will be leaving for a short while.
Prez, we haven't finished-
But keep in mind that even if you get promoted,
a fallen angel isn't that easy to defeat alone.
I know that much...
Are you going to go?
Yeah. Don't try and stop me.
You'll be killed.
Even if I'm killed, I'll let Asia escape.
It seems you're prepared for the worst.
Though it's still hopeless.
Shut up, will you-
What?
I'll go along as well.
You...
Prez said, "even if you get a promotion..." correct?
Yeah.
At that moment, Prez accepted the church as the "back of the board."
Then...
And we still have our orders to follow you.
Koneko-chan, as well?
I can't let the two of you go by yourselves.
This is lame.
Why do I have to stand guard?
What do I have here?
I'll introduce myself, a fallen angel, Mystel.
Why, how polite of you.
Did your master sense us coming and send you?
They sure seem to be apprehensive about our movements.
Nope, they just didn't want to be
interrupted in the middle of their ritual.
Oh, sorry. Our stimulated friends went over to your master's place just now.
Wait, seriously?
Yes. Right up the front entrance.
Dammit, I kept imagining they'd try sneaking in through the back!
Well, does it make a difference.
It doesn't matter how many people interfere,
I just need to settle this with you now,
since you two are going to be the real problem, right?
Thanks for taking your time to come all the way here.
It doesn't really matter to us what our friends do.
Huh?
I'm not going.
So, you're just going to abandon them?
What bad luck.
It seems like plenty of priests are gathered as well.
Really? Thank goodness you two came along.
Well, we are family.
Besides, I don't like priests.
You can even say, I hate them.
Kiba?
Koneko-chan?
They've surely noticed us by now.
This is horrible.
Hello, hello, hello!
We meet again.
Oh, how my heart leaps with joy.
Freed!
I didn't think there'd be a devil who can meet me twice.
After all, I'm really strong.
Usually, I kill them all on our first encounter.
You know, you're annoying me.
You piece of shit devils dare to humiliate me!
Where's Asia?!
Oh, that shit exorcist of a sister? She's down at the ritual right now.
Well, nearby. Not that it matters.
Sacred Gear!
Just get crushed already.
You're annoying, midget.
Midget?
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
You fight well.
You really make me want to kill you.
I guess he does have good traits other than just his face.
Shall I show you a bit of my serious side?
What the hell is this?
Devil's Blade.
A blade of darkness that feeds on holy energy.
What the hell are you babbling about?
You have a Sacred Gear too?
Hyoudou-kun!
Move!!
Yes sir!
Will you shut up?!
So in other words, if I can crush you, the master, your puppets will shrivel up and die?
Well then, sounds like my perfect kind of job!
Since when did you get to talk like you're so important?
It appears that we meet again, Gremory.
Your servants have their limits too, you know.
Oh my, it seems we're all here.
Promotion!
A rook is like a tank.
It possesses unsurpassable brute strength and-
For real!
...a punch straight from hell!!
You did horrible things to Asia. I feel much better now.
Quit fucking with me. Quit fucking around with me!!
Ouchie!
There's no way devils like you can kill me!
Like hell,
so good bye!
He ran.
While we can, let's go on ahead.
The fact that you're here and causing trouble to our rituals, is more than problematic.
We won't be holding back now!
Akeno.
Yes, Prez.
What are you doing, competing with me in a cosplay battle?!
A barrier?
Isn't this sort of bad?
You can't run from me now.
You bitch, from the beginning you...
Yes. We intended to trap and clean you up, from the beginning.
Sorry for the trouble.
Quit messing with us!
Why don't you all quietly disappear?
Consider yourselves lucky to be still standing.
Anything you do, can be easily cancelled, if you lose your consciousness.
Welcome, devils.
You're late to the party.
Asia!!
Issei-san?
Asia, I'm coming right now!
Watch out!!
Such a happy reunion, it's too bad.
The ritual's almost over.
What do you plan on doing to, Asia?
I get it now. The fallen angel's plan is to...
I get it. So you fallen angels plan to steal the sister's Sacred Gear.
Steal her Sacred Gear?
What the hell happens to Asia, then?!
The possessor of the sacred gear will lose their life.
Asia will... die?
Twilight Healing. Finally, in my hands.
Next Episode
It's your reward for coming this far.
You think I'll let you live, you idiot?!
You shouldn't underestimate Issei.
After all, he's my most powerful pawn.

The 5th story ｢I'm Going to Overthrow my Ex-Girlfriend!｣
Finally, the power I sought!
With this, I'm unstoppable!
I can finally grasp it!
This supreme power!
I can finally become the supreme fallen angel!
I'll make those who ridiculed me pay!
Who are you kidding?!
You devil!
Stop right there!
Move!
I don't have time to deal with the likes of you!
Damn you!
Kiba. Koneko-chan.
Thank you!
Asia!
Asia?
Here's my gift for getting this far.
Asia!
Asia, are you okay?
Issei-san?
I'm here to save you. Just hang on.
Okay.
I'll give her to you.
Don't screw with me! Give her back her Sacred Gear!
Please, enough of the jokes.
I've even had to oppose my superiors to get my plans this far.
Sorry, but you'll have to become proof of my accomplishment.
Though it shouldn't matter. You'll both quietly die together, anyway.
Hyoudou-kun, we're at disadvantage here!
You were my first girlfriend.
Yes, It was quite fun. Especially since you knew nothing about women.
I tried to care...
If I showed even a little frown, you gave me all the attention in the world.
However, I did all of that on purpose.
The face you put on when you're worried is so weird!
I really loved you. I thought about everything I can do.
I tried to make it the best date in the world.
Yes. It was quite an evil date.
Thanks to that, it was quite boring.
Yuuma-chan...
You fight well.
How long will that barrier hold?
Some of your barriers have already depleted.
Oh, will you get rid of them and let us run?
Well even if you do so,
we're not gonna have your way.
I bet all of your servants are
writhing in pain about right now.
Especially that lecherous kid who seemed so attached to you.
I bet he was the first one to die!
It'd be best if you don't underestimate Issei.
Oh?
After all, he's my most powerful pawn.
Yuuma. Yes, I chose that name so you could die by a graceful woman with an elegant name.
Isn't it nice?
Yet, not only would you not die, but you went ahead and made this blonde chick your new lady.
You're so terrible, Issei. I bet you asked her out on another one of those boring dates!
Well, it might have been perfect for such a simple girl.
"It was the most fun I've had in my life!" Was it?
Reinare!
You brat! You have no right to utter my name!
You'll taint it!
Her presence is the one tainting everything!
Kiba?
Koneko-chan?!
Hyoudou-kun, run!
We'll make a way for you to escape!
Go! Leave the rest to us!
Please hurry.
But-
It's fine.  Just get going Hyoudou-kun!
Kiba, Koneko-chan. When we get back home, call me Issei.
Promise me that!
It's alright. We're family anyways!
Pawn?
Have devils always treated their servants like scum?
Pawns are those things lined up in the front, right?
Hmph! So a dispensable piece?
My master wouldn't resort to using something like that.
Asia, hang in there.
We just need to get out of here and you'll be free!
You can play and have fun with me any time!
Even if it is for a short time,
I'm so happy I could make a friend.
What are you saying? There are plenty of places I need to take you to!
Karaoke, amusement parks, bowling. We need to take more pictures, too!
And... and I need to let you meet my friends, too!
They're a bit perverted, but they're great people!
They'll definitely be great friends, Asia!
We'll laugh together and have loads of fun!
So much that it'll seem silly!
If only I were born in this country and could attend the same school as you, Issei-san.
Then you should. You'll attend the same school as me!
You're letting tears flow over me.
I'm so happy...
...thank you.
Asia...
Why? Why do you have to die?!
She's so nice...
...she'd even heal a devil!
God, aren't you listening?!
I beg you! Please Let this girl live!
She hasn't done anything wrong!
She only asked for friends!
Is it wrong because I am a devil?
Is it her fault because I'm a devil?!
Are you listening, God?!
Is a devil showing remorse in a church?
What a bad joke.
Reinare!
You seem to have quite the pawn.
However, he has no chance against Reinare-sama.
After all, she's his ex-girlfriend!
I heard what happened with him. It's so damn hilarious!
Don't mention it, Mystel. I'm guffawing at the mere memory.
Well, at least it made for a nice story.
Prez!
She deflected it?!
You laughed at my servant.
You laughed, didn't you?
Oh my. You guys picked a fight with the wrong person.
Look at this. On my way here, that boy cut me.
What happened to Kiba and Koneko-chan?
Isn't it beautiful? It instantaneously
heals any wounds I suffer.
Having God's divine protection is quite an amazing thing to us fallen angels.
Now my position as a fallen angel is through the roof.
Oh great Azeru-sama, Shimahaza-sama,
I can be of assistance!
Like I give a damn.
It didn't matter to this girl whether
you were a devil or a fallen angel.
It was her duty as one given a Sacred Gear.
The hell "her duty"! She could've lived a peaceful life!
That's impossible.
What?
To humans, Sacred Gears only brings about maliciousness.
Regardless of how amazing its power,
it's a double-edged sword not made for people.
Those who possess power to heal evil were called heretics.
I have no friends.
It's too bad. That's how humans are.
Even though it's such a beautiful power.
But, I'm her friend!
She's my friend and I tried to save her!
But she's dead!
She died right there!
It's not a matter of being able to protect or not.
The fact is that you failed to protect her!
Both back then, and now!
I know. That's why it's unforgivable.
Me, too. I'm also unforgiveable!
Remember, the Sacred Gear activates on the user's will.
Give it back!
The stronger the will, the more powerful the power.
Give me back Asia!
It will respond.
Dragon Blaster!
I told you already, to split one into two doesn't do a whole lot.
Boost!
It seems your power isn't completely useless.
Hadena Fansubs
High School
DxD
Holy objects are poisonous to devils.
Just touching it can disable you!
And that's what makes devils so weak.
Especially low-grade devils like you.
What's wrong with being low-grade?
This is nothing...
...compared to what Asia suffered through!
This is nothing!
Boost!
You're not too shabby.
Even for a low-grade, you've gone so far. I compliment you!
My strength...
But it appears that you're at your limit.
It wouldn't be strange if you just dropped dead right now.
You're quite resilient.
God...
No, that won't work.
Since I'm a devil, I guess it's a devil king.
I'm sure they exist... devil kings.
Since I'm a devil, mind listening to me?
What's this? Are you in so much pain that you're broken?
I ask for nothing more than this, so please.
No, impossible!
Please, let me punch this bitch just once!
There's no way you should be able to stand!
Your entire body was scorched by the holy spears!
There's no way a devil ought to be able to withstand that!
Yeah, it hurts all right.
It hurts like a bitch.
It hurts so much I feel like I could collpase at any moment.
But you piss me off so much that it doesn't matter to me anymore!
Explosion!
What? A surge of power?
Impossible, there's no way.
That Sacred Gear, it's only a Twice Critical. It shouldn't be able to.
Why?!
You think I'd let you get away?!
I-I'm the supreme fallen ange-
Shut up, you damn angel!
Serves you right.
Impressive. You took out a fallen angel by yourself.
You're late, Prince Charming.
Prez told me to let you handle it on your own.
Prez?
That's right. I believed you'd be able to handle her on your own.
Prez.
I finished some of my business so I warped here,
only to be greeted by Yuuto and Koneko-chan being swarmed by priests.
It's thanks to you that we were all saved.
I feel like it was my loss for worrying, now.
Prez, I brought her here.
Nice to meet you, fallen angel Reinare.
I'm Rias Gremory, leader of this sect of the Gremorys.
Are you the daughter of the Gremory household?
I'm honored that you're acquainted with me.
Even though our time together will be short.
Also, the friends you brought along. I blew them away with a spectacular show.
"Blew them away?"
She's known as the Princess with Scarlet Hair. Also called Princess of Obliteration.
"Obliteration?" I'm glad I joined this family.
My, my. They left such a mess.
You, the daughter of Gremory...
How dare you!
I knew you fallen angels were plotting something
ever since my first encounter with Donashiku.
If you hadn't attacked my servant, we would have left you alone, but...
Prez, then all of this, for me?
Issei, is that your Sacred Gear?
Oh, it changed shapes before I knew it.
It's quite red. I see.
I see how it is.
Fallen angel Reinare. Hyoudou Issei's Sacred Gear is not a Twice Critical.
What?
They say it doubles the user's power within ten
seconds and then surpasses all limits beyond imagination.
One of the Thirteen Longuines.
The Forearm of the Inferno Dragon.
Boosted Gear.
The gear that is said to destroy even the gods.
This kid possesses it?!
Regardless of how powerful his strength is, he's not invincible. It takes time to activate.
He was only able to win because you took your guard down.
Now I'll have you disappear, fallen angel.
Issei-kun.
Help me.
I only said those things because of my role as a fallen angel!
Yuuma-chan.
Look, I still have this. It's the
proof that I haven't forgotten!
You bought me this...
Why do you still have this?
I couldn't just throw it away!
Since you...
This is bad, Koneko-chan.
Help me, Issei-kun!
Just how far are you...
Prez. Please.
It is as my cute servant wishes.
W-Will you go out with me?
P-Please go out with me!
Let's give this back to her.
Yeah.
Prez. I'm sorry, even after all of you helped me...
...I wasn't able to protect Asia.
It's fine. You simply lacked experience as a devil. No one will hold it against you.
But... But I...
I'm not sure of the outcome, but it's worth trying.
What does this look like?
A chess piece?
To be more precise, a bishop.
Akeno-san?
The role of a bishop is to follow their family.
This girl and her healing ability should be quite useful.
Prez, you're...
I'm going to try to convert this sister into a devil.
I commandeth thee as Rias Gremory.
Mine command, Asia Argent,
is that thy shalt walk again upon this earth.
In exchange, thy shall becometh mine servant!
I seal this contract. Walk again!
Prez, is Asia...?
Be quiet.
Asia?
Prez?
I wanted someone with the power to heal devils too. That's why I converted her.
The rest is your responsibilty.
After all, you are her senior.
Issei-san?
Well... uh... I...
Thank goodness, Asia.
Hey, it's morning. Oh, wake up! Where are you-
Good morning!
Oh, you're here.
How are your wounds?
They're healing well, thanks to Asia's healing.
It seems she's already proving
her worthiness as a bishop.
I can see why the fallen angels would want her.
Um, Prez?
Yes?
There are as many Evil Pieces as chess pieces, right?
Yes.
Does that mean that there will eventually be seven more pawns like me?
It's just I was thinking about how I'd have rivals and...
Just kidding! I'm kidding!
My only pawn is you, Issei.
When making a contract, the number of pieces it consumes
varies depending on the intelligence and power of the new unit.
"Consumes?"
The pieces I need are a knight, a bishop, a rook, and seven pawns.
When I tried to convert you, it took me eight "pieces" just to convert you.
I took the worth of eight pieces?!
When I saw that, I just knew I had to make you my servant.
A human with that kind of potential is extremely rare.
I betted on that chance.
You ended up possessing one of the Longuines and the Boosted Gear, after all.
Boosted Gear? The Forearm of the Inferno Dragon.
The Princess with Scarlet Hair and the Forearm of the Inferno Dragon.
Both red and matching.
Y-Yeah.
Aim to become the most powerful pawn.
I know you can do it.
After all, you are my cute servant.
Most powerful pawn, I like the ring of that! Now, I can continue to-
Here's your reward. Work hard.
Prez, I'll do my best!
Well, I can't keep babysitting you forever.
It might not leave the best impression
on our newest addition.
Newest?
Issei-san?
Asia?
I-I understand. Rias-san is, of course,
more beautiful than I.
It's only logical that you'd like her, Issei-san.
N-No. No! I mustn't think of these things!
Lord, cleanse my thoughts of-
What's wrong?
I suddenly have this headache.
Of course, you're a devil now.
That's right. I'm a devil now.
Are you regretting it?
Not at all. Thank you so much.
Regardless of the method, as long as I can be with Issei-san, I'll be happy.
Anyway, your outfit?
Does it look good?
So Asia is enrolling in this school?
My father's words carry some weight
in this school, after all.
This is no big deal.
I-I didn't know.
Good morning, Issei-kun.
Good morning, Issei-senpai.
Oh my, everyone's here together.
Now, let's celebrate our newest family member!
Issei.
Yes?
You were the best.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful last episode. Just kidding!

N-No, it just happened to get in my face...

I'll pick you up by five.
Five in the morning? Okay.
Then, I'll be off to hand out our flyers.
See you.
Asia?
Yes!

Episode 6 "I'm a Demon, Hard at Work!"
Cough, cough.
I-It's morning! Wake up!
Cough, cough, cough.
Please wake up! Wake up! Cough, cou—
Come on! It's only four thirty.
P-President!
I'll be right there!
Hey! Pull yourself together!
Y-Yes!
I will become the Harem King!
I didn't expect demons to train like athletes!
Don't grumble!
I don't want to see my servants being weak.
I-I will do my best!
Listen. Physical strength essentially determines your standing in the demon world.
Especially for you, Issei.
G-Got it!
Her breasts! Her breasts!
Do you understand?
Given your ability, your power will increase with greater physical strength.
Yes, ma'am!
Eleven! Twelve!
The President's ass feels so nice!
You're having naughty thoughts.
Your hip movements gave you away!
I can't help it!
This is cranking my animal lust up to the maximum!
She should be here about now.
Huh? Is someone coming?
Sorry!
Issei-san, President, I'm sorry I'm late—
Why did I have to trip?
Here you go.
Thanks.
Asia, why are you here?
She told me to come.
President, why'd you call Asia here?
President?
Oh, yes.
What's wrong?
Now that Asia's here, let's go.
Go where?
Your home, Issei.
Wh-What are all these...?
Those are my belongings.
Turns out I had a lot more than I thought.
These are yours? President!?
That's right! Asia will be living at your place from now on.
Sorry!?
I am fortunate to be in your care.
I asked her where she'd like to board, and she picked your home!
Y-You can't just do that so suddenly—
A-Asia-san, was it?
Yes, Mr. Hyoudou.
W-Wouldn't a different family be better as a homestay?
Issei-san did me a real favor.
A favor?
Yes, he helped me so much when I first came here; when I was all alone.
I think it would be really nice to stay in this house.
Asia!
But if it is a bother, I won't insist.
We're not saying no!
We do have an empty room.
But...
Our son is basically the incarnation of lust!
Yeah!
Don't say it like that! I'm your son!
Then how about teaching her to be a housewife while staying here?
W-Wife!?
H-Honey! I never thought I'd get to see my grandson in this life!
Dear, me too! I can't believe this failure of a son managed to...
Hey, wait a second!
Mr. and Mrs. Hyoudou, Issei-san is not a failure at all.
Sh-She's such a kind girl!
Rias-san, we'll take care of Asia-san!
Please, let us take care of her!
Thank you very much, Mr. and Mrs. Hyoudou!
That settles it.
Um, a housewife and a wife are two
completely different things, you know?
Wife, huh?
President?
My name is Asia Argento!
I may still be new to this place,
but I'm glad to meet you!
A blonde beauty!
Bust 82, waist 55, hip 81. Good!
Oh, right.
She's in my class.
This is also the President's...
I'm currently staying at Hyoudou Issei-san's place!
What!?
Explain! Why are you living with a blonde beauty!?
Why are you the only one getting all these chances!?
I didn't have a choice!
Who made the decision then!?
That's a relief. Looks like she'll get along with everybody.
Say, does your room have a lock, Asia-san?
It does!
Check the bath and toilet carefully.
Check it?
Yes, you never know if there's a camera installed.
Camera?
Hey, you guys!
You must be exhausted.
Not at all! Everyone in the class was nice to me.
Your friends Matsuda-san and Motohama-san were also...
D-Did they do something to you?
He said I'm invited to the next gentlemen's gathering.
Hm? Just ignore that.
Oh.
S-Sorry.
Don't mind it. I'm all right.
Issei-san?
N-Nothing! Let's keep going.
Okay!
President, we just got back.
Um, President?
I'm sorry. I was spacing out a bit.
Thanks for your work, you two.
Asia?
Yes?
I'm thinking about having you debut tonight.
Debut?
You teleport to the target through a magic circle
and form a contract!
Wait, isn't this too early?
Asia has been a demon only for a few days.
It's no problem.
As far as I've figured out, Asia-chan's demonic power ranks just below mine in this household!
S-Seriously?
You'll be a very capable bishop.
You're amazing, Asia-san!
N-Not at...
It's certainly a great thing, but I feel a little beat down.
No, I still have more experience!
I have to protect Asia!
What's the matter, Asia?
It's nothing.
Since that's your order...
President!
What?
Let me go this time!
I-Issei-san?
You're still not familiar with this country.
I think you should wait until after you
are a little more used to living here.
To be honest, I was worried as well.
It could always be some sort of deviant summoning her.
If I form a contract, you'll do everything I say, right?
Oh, no!
Well, that's probably just my imagination going wild, but still...
It's open! Come inyo!
"Inyo"?
What was that...?
Welcome.
I'm Mil-tan.
Nyo!
Sir, did you summon a demon from the Gremory household by any chance?
I sure did.
I summoned you to do me a favor.
Wh-What?
Please... Please make me a magical girl!
You should travel to a parallel universe or something.
I tried that already.
You did!?
Demon-san!
Sorry!
Please grant me fantasy powers.
You already look fantastical.
I want magical powers!
Calm down!
We don't want to wake the neighbors,
so let's go inside, okay?
You're going to make me a magical girl!?
We can talk about it.
Th-Then let's...

This again? So, it was an altogether different kind of deviant...
Why do I only get weirdos?
The President!?
Good work. Looks like you've finished the job.
How was it?
Actually...
All right? The bloomers will look like
panties if you concentrate enough!
I see it, Motohama!
I can see it too!
The blue bloomers were white before I knew it!
You couldn't get a contract this time, either?
The anime he showed me was fun, so I ended up watching it with him till the end.
I'm sorry.
Well, if you couldn't get it, forget about it.
She definitely sounded disappointed.
I'm such an idiot!
The sun's also too bright.
I'll just skip class and take a nap.
P-President!
M-My hand is moving on its own!
Stop! Don't do it, right hand!
Just a little farther!
Oh, Issei.
Um, how'd this happen?
I was feeling a little languid, so I thought I'd take a little nap.
Then I found you sleeping here.
Oh, oops.
Did I disturb your sleep?
Not at all, but isn't it a little too extreme to nap naked...
I can't fall asleep unless I'm nude.
Issei, could it be you like breasts?
Yes, I love them!
Do you want to touch my breasts?
Do you want to touch my breasts?
Wh-Who knew such a wonderful phrase exists!?
I'll let you if you do me a favor.
Yes, anything!
Well, then, form a contract with someone.
Um, are we really going together?
As I said, I'll be accompanying you as a supervisor this time.
Well, if I'm with her, there's no way I'll fail.
Then...
Do your best, Issei-san!
Oh, I'll do my best, Asia!
Off you go!
It looks like an apartment.
But what's all this Warring States Period stuff?
Oh, are you the demons?
Um, excuse me, but are you a woman?
Yes.
My name is Susan.
I came here to study because I love Japanese culture.
B-But that getup is...
Oh, I'm sorry!
I clad myself in armor to be protected
from the dangers of the night.
I think you're doing it wrong.
But, I'm glad nice demons like you came.
If scary demons had come, I would've had to... had to draw this Kijinmaru Kunishige!
You just drew it!
So, Susan-san, what do you want us to do?
Please accompany me to the university, so I can retrieve the notes I left there.
That's it?
The university is scary at night!
You're the scariest here.
Damn it. Why am I getting summoned by all these freaks?
What's wrong?
S-Sorry, streets at night are scary.
You are the one who's scary!
Th-Thank you so much.
See you, then.
I fulfilled my promise to the President!
With this, I can grope her breasts without holding back!
I'll start with the right, moving my hands in a circle.
As for the left one, I'll jerk that soft flesh like crazy!
U-Um...
What is it!?
Actually, I have another favor to ask.
Um, we can't really do that.
It's one wish per summon.
Oh, we don't mind.
P-President!
A boy you fell in love with?
Yes.
I'm shy and thus couldn't express my feelings.
He's a very wonderful man.
I bet he looks like a hairy warrior from the Warring States Period.
So, you want us to make him fall in love with you?
If possible, I don't want any demonic powers involved.
I want to earn his love on my own.
That means you don't need us!
Then, why don't you confess to him right away?
That's... I can't just do that!
Maybe a letter?
A letter?
Oh, yeah, a love letter might be a good idea.
Love letter!
It's wonderful to convey one's feelings in writing.
O-Okay! I'll give it a try!
I am writing you about no specific order of business,
thus you may set your mind to ease.
Sounds like an official address.
It's all right.
It's the feelings that matter, not the form.
I'm not sure if that'll get the feelings across.
Yes, it's not the form.
It isn't... about the form.
President?
I'm done!
Sending letters via arrow!? Are you kidding me!?
Mom, what is that?
Don't look.
What is this?
Seems like he's here.
Wh-What!?
The arrow!
Susan!
The arrow is stuck in his head!
Yes, I thought about different ways to do it,
but sending a message by arrow was
the only thing I could manage.
B-But that's...
I have read your letter.
It was a wonderful message!
I'm amazed you caught me off guard and shot me with an arrow.
What a letter!
Oh no, all I was thinking was how to get it to you,
Horii-kun!
I feel like I'm going mad.
I-I want to go out with you if you don't mind.
What!?
Ho-Horii-kun!
I'm so happy!
Susan!
Your armor is wonderful.
Wow, your armor is also so hard and sturdy!
They are the perfect couple.
Y-You're right...
in a way.
Say, Issei...
Y-Yes?
How do you feel about having a romantic relationship with someone you love?
What I feel about it? Wouldn't it be bliss?
Right, bliss.
I mean...
You should never go out with someone you don't even love.
That's just wrong.
So...
Huh?
What am I saying? Sorry.
Oh no, I appreciate the answer.
Didn't you say you want to talk about something, Issei?
Oh, right!
I almost forgot!
All right! No one's around!
Now's the time for her part of the deal!
It's about the promise we made last time!
Promise?
Did we ever make a promise?
U-Um... about the b-breasts!
I know.
You don't need to be so serious about it.
All right, until I've counted to five...
my breasts are yours.
One!
That's too sudden!
Two!
This is bad! I didn't have a chance to prepare myself!
Three!
Calm down! I need to calm down!
Right? Or left?
Four!
I-I'll just grope both of them!
Issei-san, you're here already?
Sorry, we're late.
Hello.
Five.
All right, that's it!
Too bad, Issei.
Oh my, what happened, Issei-kun?
No way!
Issei, you're so funny.
You wanted to touch my breasts that badly?
Then I'll do this for just a little bit.
U-Um, everyone's watching.
Keep working hard, my cute Issei.
I-I will.

Episode 7 "I'm Gonna Get a Servant Demon!"
What a beautiful development!﻿I'm done preparing!
All right. Let's get to handing out these pamphlets, then.
Let's go, Asia.
Hold up.
Yes?
This will be your last week handing those out.
I told you before.
I've only been making you hand them out as training,
but it's really just a familiar's job.
Does that mean we're graduating from this job?
But first, you two will have to get your own familiars.

The 7th story ｢I`ll Get a Familiar!｣
This is my familiar. You've seen it before, right, Issei?
So, the girl from that time was you!
This is mine.
A cactus?
This is Shiro.
Mine is-
I don't need to see it.
You're no fun.
They're really helpful since you're a devil.
You can use them to help you gather
information, and also track people.
Um, how exactly do we get a familiar?
That's...
Yes?
Pardon us.
T-These people are...!
Who is she?
She's this school's student counsel president, Shitori Souna-senpai.
Next to her is Shinga Tsubaki-senpai, the vice-president.
Except the entire student counsel is here!
What's up? You're all here.
You seem to have acquired more servants
so I figured I'd drop by and greet them.
Servants? Are these people...?
Her proper name is Sounashitori.
She's the leader of another party of high leveled devils.
This school has other devils besides us?
Rias-senpai, you hadn't told them about us?
Though, the fact that they hadn't noticed us,
even though we're all devils, is laughable.
Saji, we're not supposed to be interacting with each other.
It's no mystery that Hyoudou-kun hadn't noticed us.
Oh, you're that new guy who
recently joined the student council.
Second year, class C...
Saji Genshiro. He's a pawn.
He's our pawn, Hyoudou Issei.
She's our bishop, Asia Argent.
So, we're both pawns! We're the same grade, too!
My pride's quite hurt, considering that I have to be...
...put on the same level as you, a lecherous pervert.
What the hell is your problem?
Want to start?
I might be new but I'm a pawn worth four pieces!
Saji, step down. That pawn over there is worth eight.
Eight? That's all the pieces!
I can't believe it! This worthless-
Shut it!
My apologies, Hyoudou-kun, Argent-san.
If it's not too much trouble, could you
guys try to get along as newcomers?
Saji?
All right.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too!
No, no. The pleasure is all mine, meeting
such a beautiful girl like yourself.
Nice to meet you, too, Saji-kun.
Let me tell you something. If you do
anything to Asia, your head will be on a platter.
So, you're going to keep that blonde
chick all to yourself, you sick pervert?
My deepest condolences…
Same to you.
I've already made my debut and I'm
just about to get myself a familiar.
While you're still handing out pamphlets.
Why don't you shut it? I just got
permission to get my own familiar.
Oh, you too?
Yeah. I'd planned for next week,
He only accepts offers once a month, so...
How about we put their skills in battle?
Battle?
The winner reserves the right to get a familiar.
Are you asking for a rating game?
As if. There's no way that'd be approved.
You're right.
Not to mention that body of yours is irreplaceable.
That has nothing to do with it.
Yes.
We ought to settle this like
high schoolers, with a sport!
Go, Prez! Akeno-san!
Class President, please win!
Akeno, we'll be winning this one.
Of course, Prez.
We're starting, Souna.
Ready when you are.
Of course, I want Prez to win. But,
I wouldn't mind if time stopped here.
It sure is a beautiful sight.
Sure is!
Wait, you two?!
The most beautiful girls in
our school are battling it out with...
...extremely short skirts and giving us all this eyecandy.
As if we could pass up this opportunity
to see the swiftness of their strokes.
Not to mention, their arms are almost
made for playing tennis.
Where are you looking? Between the legs is where it's at!
Now that I think about it, there are
a lot more people watching.
Souna-sama!
Akeno Onee-sama!
I thought they wouldn't use magic at all.
Take this,
Shitori Grand Slam!
Too easy. Take the "Gremory Dragon Counter!"
Fifteen-Thirty!
Damn!
Way to go, President!
They're using their magic powers now.
They're getting too worked up.
It's a magical ball!
It's filled with magic!
They seem to believe it’s a “magical ball.”
I'm so very glad it works out that well.
A fitting action for my rival. However,
I'll be walking away the winner, tonight!
With my magic, you'll be taking the force of a hundred balls at once!
Bring it on.
It's only fit since we're rivals!
So in the end,
neither side gave up.
A tie?
So, the two are in a meeting at the moment.
We're playing dodgeball next.
The match is tomorrow night in the gym.
Let's all try our best for Issei and Asia.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
Everyone...
Are you awake, Asia?
Issei-san!
Please, come in.
I know it's late. But do you have
a needle and thread by any chance?
Huh?
The other side has two extra players,
so I've asked for assistance.
I haven't played dodgeball since elementary school.
Since the point is to win, the simpler the rules, the better.
Even Asia-san was able to learn the rules fairly quickly.
I can't do this anymore!
Just a bit more.
O-Okay.
When I'm watching those two...
Your so cute.
My imagination runs wild.
\h\hPower
Focus
Head bands?
Oh my, how beautiful.
I pulled an all nighter making these.
All nighter?
Everyone's doing so much for us. Yesterday, you and Akeno-san worked hard.
Today, even Koneko-chan and Kiba are working for our sake.
I just thought it'd be nice if...
...I could make something to show my appreciation.
There're lame, aren't they?
No, they're great! They're beautiful!
You flatter me.
They're a lot better than I expected.
Let's do our best and win!
Yes!
Sorry for the wait.

Out!
Koneko-chan!
I'm fine.
Next one coming up!!
As expected. You took Subaki's smash head on.
Just who do you think I am?
No!
Issei-kun!
Oh my, you mustn't let your guard down!
I'm sorry!
Take this!!
Dodgeball is too scary!
I don't even know what we're playing anymore!
President, let's take out Hyoudou first!
Backspin Shoot!
What?
Why?!
Issei! Dodge it!
My life is over.
I'll heal you with my twilight healing.
Show me where you're injured.
T-That's not possible!
But if I don't see, I can't properly treat it!
You really don't want me showing you that!
Please, let me off the hook for this one!
Fine... with your clothes on.
Are you okay?!
Yeah...
I can't even comment on this scene.
I feel the exact same.
Asia, you keep nursing him.
Got it!
Everyone, for Issei!
Yes. It's for Issei-kun.
We mustn't let this go to waste.
Of course.
Um, I haven't died.
Now, make sure you heal!
Come at me!
You're the only one left, Souna! Give it up already!
The fun is just about to begin.
Time's up!
We won! We won!
We did it!
Now, as promised I'll be taking priority for the familiar.
Of course. I'm a bit sad, but at least it was fun.
Although, if this were a rating game,
instead of having fun, I wouldn't lose.
It's not like I can lose to my childhood friend, you, either.
Well, time will tell.
Agreed. Now, I'll be taking my leave.
Rating game?
Cheers!
We decisively defeated the student council!
We, the Occult Research Club, made a name for ourselves!
And we owe our success to you all.
But, I had to sit out...
It's thanks to these headbands that we won.
That's right!
Yeah, Issei-san!
Kiba, you scoundrel, but sometimes
you do say, some very good things!

Now, we can't just sit around here for too long.
We have familiars to catch.
Um, right now?
It has to be a full moon or we won't be able to meet him.
"Him?"
The Familiar Master!
Where...
The forest where familiars reside.
This is where we got our familiars, too.
True. I wouldn't be surprised if something came out.
Agreed.
Got to catch 'em all!
Who are you?!
I'm Zattuji, the Familiar Master!
Familiar...
...Master?
It's a nice full moon. Perfect for catching familiars!
Stick with me and you can get any familiar known to man!
This man's a professional when it comes to familiars.
I see.
What kind of familiar do you want?
Fast? Strong?
Or maybe even poisonous?
Let's see, how about one that's cute? A girl?
Tsk tsk tsk. This is why novices are no good.
Familiars aren't just chosen like that.
They're chosen according to who you are and what best matches you!
Um, I'd like a cute familiar if possible as well!
Of course!
Thank you so much!
Hey, you...
In this lake resides a lake ghost called the Undine.
All right! A lake ghost!
From its name...
As the future harem king, she'd let
me rest my head on her lap,
clean my ears, and let me extend my
arms and grab her soft breasts!
The water is...
Undine's coming out!
What!
That's Undine!
No way! That has to be just some
crazy muscleman in the water!
You're in luck, boy!
It has a high power level even for a lake ghost!
This is horrible!
I don't want her! She'll kill me if I get close to her!
But it's a girl.
I didn't need to know that!
That girl had a powerful appearance.
I'm sure she's a nice person.
Please, don't call that thing a girl.
Wait.
Look!
A dragon?
How cute!
A sprite dragon.
It's the child of a dragon that strikes blue lightning.
It's a rather high leveled and rare familiar.
It's the first time I've seen it.
If you're going to catch it, now's your chance.
If you let the chance slip by, you'll forever lose it.
Issei-kun possesses the inate power
of a dragon. I think they'd get along.
I see. All right, Sprite dragon you are-
Asia!
Oh my!
Slimes?
Oh my!
Oh my!
How filthy!
Stop it!
My clothes… my clothes…!
It's slimy. Disgusting.
Shit!
W-What a beautiful turn of events!
Don't look.
You say that, but how could I-
I can't even use my magic now!
Oh my. This is bad!
Prez!!
Shit, what do I do? What do I do?
This familiar is a special type.
It only melts the clothes of females.
A slime that melts clothes?!
Prez, I want to make this slime my familiar!
Oh my. No, not there!
Alright!
These things are my dream companions!
Issei, familiars are supposed to be important!
Think about this properly!
I've thought it through! I want them!
Oh my, I'm sorry.
Move, Issei. I'm going to burn these disgusting things alive.
No! These slimes were meant to be my companions!
There's no doubt what's happened here is a sign for me!
This is fate! We are no longer strangers!
Issei-san is holding onto me!
Suratarou, my loved companion!
He's already given it a name...
It's the first time I've seen a devil want
the nuisance of the forest this much.
The world's a damned large place,
housing these loonies.
He's usually so nice.
However, when his fantasies
become so strong they take over...
Prez, don't look at me like I deserve pity!
I'll use these guys to become a kingly master!
What was that...
Was that the sprite dragon's lightning?
Suratarou!
You bastard-
Issei-san!
This is...
That fellow only attacks those he thinks are harming others.
Basically, it thought the slime and the boy were attacking the blonde.
So, basically...
So cute!
I guess it's settled. Girl, that familiar is yours!
My name is Asia Argent.
From today onwards you shall become my servant, my underling, and my familiar.
All right, now it's over.
Nice job, Asia-chan.
That tickles, Rassei-kun!
Rassei?
Yeah. It shoots lightning so the "ra" sounded fitting. Also, I borrowed from your name a bit.
I guess it's fine. Nice to meet you, Rassei.
I forgot to mention, but dragons absolutely hate anyone other than their master.
So selfish, Rassei.
Why did you die, Suratarou?!
We could have done so much together!!
Leecherous pervert.
Normally, sprite dragons only open their hearts
to the purest of hearts.
Usually they completely disregard devils all together.
Maybe it can tell you used to be a Sister, Asia.
You bastard, Rassei, what are you doing?!
Rassei-kun, you mustn't do that!
Now, good night, Rassei-kun!
To think my underclassman's more
devil-like than me. It's a bit depressing.
Damn, one of these day's I'll get a
familiar that'll make you all jealous!
We'll await that day.
Anyway, see you all tomorrow!
See you!
Issei's got a lot to do!
It is just the beginning after all.
Yup.
That's right.
Next Episode
What a rose-colored moment!
Issei-san, do you like seeing people naked?
He's son-in-law and the next heir for Gremory's clan.
The 8th story ｢I challenge you to a Fight!｣
Please, I want you to take my virginity.
As soon as possible!﻿I can't believe it!
There has to be a mistake!
What?
What are you two talking about?
W-What is this?!
There's no way Issei can get married.
How can this be happening?
M-Marry?!
Issei, you actually have a girl now!
I completely...
...thought you'd grow up to be a useless lecherous pervert!
Hey!
You shouldn't hesitate, Issei.
P-Prez?!
Rias-sama, you're so beautiful!
Why did you choose a guy like him?
I'm marrying Prez?!
...for better for worse, for richer for poorer,
Since when did things take this kind of turn?
Well, since it's Prez, it's not like I have a problem or anything.
However, marrying would mean "making babies."
And that'd be on the wedding night!
Welcome, Issei.
The groom may kiss the bride.
Mouth to mouth?!
Aren't you having fun, you damned brat.
Where did that voice come from?
Here, from inside of you.
W-Who are you?!
It's me.
I've always been talking to you.
However, perhaps because you're so young,
you haven't been able to hear me.
W-What are you talking about?!
I just wanted to greet you.
We'll be fighting alongside each other from now on, Partner.
Partner?!
What do you mean...
You didn't know?
Yes, partner.

The 8th story ｢I challenge you to a Fight!｣
You sure look tired.
Yeah.
I had a weird dream and I didn't sleep well.
What?!
If it was an erotic dream, then it'd be worth it!
That's not it.
I'm sorry.
I should have called you a bit earlier.
It's fine.
I'm the one who slept in.
Issei, why you...
you have Asia-chan wake you up?!
Well, of course!
What?!
We do live together, after all.
Issei-san sleeps in quite often.
S-So does she share food with you?
My mom was complimenting her on how
she's such a great girl the other day.
Y-You're embarrassing me.
Why is such a beautiful girl drawn to you?!
This is way too irrational!
Hey, friend.
I'm sure it's not a sin to introduce me to a friend.
Rather, I'm begging you to introduce me to someone!
Please! I beg of you!
Even if he says that... everyone's a devil.
If you introduce me, I fully intend to reward you.
Huh!
W-What do you mean?!
You could say it's a V.I.P. location of sorts.
W-Wait a minute!
There was one girl who's really nice.
Really?!
She wants to meet up today!
She'll bring her friends, too!
W-What kind of girl is she?
W-Well, a young, innocent girl. I guess.
Innocent?! Amazing!
What's her name?!
M... Miru-tan.
Oh please.
W-What is this?!
L-Look at those breasts!
There ought to be a limit on those things!
We found this excellent location, it's totally V.I.P status.
T-This is amazing!
Ah!
Koneko-chan!
W-What beautiful colored undergarments!
Woah!
This is amazing!
I feel like I've just accomplished something!
This tiny fist. Could it be?!
Yup.
Matsuda! Motohama!
Eh!
S-Sup, Koneko-chan. What a nice day.
This is pitiful.
Girl's Changing Room
I-It hurts.
Are you all right, Issei-san?
You reap what you sow.
Jeez, why did you do that?
Well, my friend invited me, so I couldn't resist.
Issei-san! I-If you want to see bare skin that much, I'll-
No! It's fine! That's not it!
Yeah, Issei.
If you ask, I'll show you whenever.
P-Prez?!
I've already shown you, anyway.
W-Well, I guess.
Ow!
Ouch! That hurts!
Jeez, Issei-san!
I don't like it when you have that look on your face, Issei-san.
That's not it. Listen to me!
It's strange, though.
Huh?
All the forms from the people Issei's visited are positive.
They all say it was fun, or they had a great time.
At the same time, he's "failing" all his assignments.
This is a first.
He's failing as a devil,
but all our clients are satisfied.
How do we deal with this?
It's a problem.
Although, it is like Issei to-
That's not it.
Hm?
The same thing applied when we went familiar hunting,
but I feel if this keeps up, Issei
will lose confidence in himself.
That's why...
...I need to take care of him a little longer.
Oh my, you're thinking positively as usual.
What are you trying to say?
I always thought you were the type
to let things work themselves out.
But at the same time, I'm not sure if suddenly
intervening so much is the right choice.
Rias, you-
Having my best friend worry about me is nice,
but this is my own problem.
Also, it's "Prez" when we're in the club room, right?
Understood, Prez.
Now, I'll be taking my leave.
Thanks for your work.
I was scorned by Koneko-chan.
I don't have any good traits.
Crap, I can't be getting depressed over this.
I will become a Harem-king!
Well, I need to get refreshed, so I'll take a bath.
Wait, why am I screaming?!
S-Sorry. I'll leave!
S-Sorry.
I-It's just it's the first time I saw
a man and couldn't respond.
My bad, too. I was lost in thought
and I didn't realize you were there.
Sorry.
But... I'm okay now!
Okay about...?
I heard there's a rule in Japan where people bathe nude together.
Rule?
Yes.
By doing so, people strengthen their
bonds and learn more about each other.
Asia! You're not wrong, but you're a bit off!
Issei-san! If it's with you, I'd like to bond more!
B-Besides, don't you like seeing bare skin?
Resist! Resist, use sense!
Asia.
When we say "bathing nude..."
Rather, you're a girl.
When a guy walks in, shouldn't you react a bit more surprised?
Asia-chan,
I'll leave your bath towel right here.
I'm not lewd.
I'm not a pervert.
I'm here to protect Asia.
I live with her, but I'm not to think lewd things of her.
I'll-
Damn it!
Why am I meditating?
What the hell happens if a devil reaches nirvana?!
Magic squares?
Prez?!
W-What happened?
Huh!
Ah! Wait!
Issei.
Make love to me!
Excuse me?
Take my virginity, please. I beg of you!

W-What is this?
What's going on?!
Was I just chosen to be her first?
Well, that's nice.
But I'm not mentally prepared!
Am I not good enough?
N-No, that's not it!
I've thought about it, but this is the only way.
O-Only way?
If the fact is established like this,
they shouldn't have any complaints.
I have certain pieces missing,
but you have the qualities.
Um, I lost you.
Besides, I feel that within minutes,
you'll be madly in love.
Prez?!
W-What's...
Issei, is this your first time?
Y-Yes.
I’m sure there will be some
awkwardness from both of us then.
But let’s do our best to get through this.
Don't worry. All you have to do, is do the deed.
Do you understand? I'm nervous, too.
Y-Yes. I can feel your heart beating.
Last time, you ran out of time.
But this time, there’s no limit.
B-but, I'm not confident enough.
Are you going to make me regret this?
No, I… Prez!
It seems we were too late.
Such a family of humble birth.
Your husband and Sazekusu-sama will be saddened.
Sazekusu?
My older brother.
Your older brother?!
My chastity is mine and mine alone.
What's the issue with me deciding who will be my first?
Furthermore,
I can't forgive people for insulting my adorable servant in that fashion.
Even if you're my brother's "queen".
Regardless of what you say, you are still heir to the Gremory line.
Please forgive me.
Nice to meet you.
I am a servant of the Gremory's.
I go by the name of Grayfia. Pleased
to make your acquaintance.
S-Same to you!
What a beautiful woman!
Sorry, Issei. That wasn't like me.
Shall we forget about this?
S-sure…
Issei? Is that...?
Yes. He's my pawn.
He possesses Boosted Gear and
the Forearm of the Inferno Dragon?
Someone like him?
W-What's wrong?
I'll listen at my headquarters.
You wouldn't mind if Akeno came along, would you?
The lightning priestess, correct? I don't mind.
It's normal to have a queen, and a devil of the same level, with you.
Sorry if I caused you any trouble.
I-It's fine.
You'll have to forgive me with just this for tonight.
What was up with Prez last night?
She was rather serious.
Issei!
You tricked us!
W-What's up? You guys are sure energetic so early in the morning!
Shut up!
What the hell did you mean, "Miru-tan"?!
He was just a ripped whacko!
And why was he wearing gothic lolita clothing?!
Is he an ultimate weapon or something?!
Wasn't he a cute guy infatuated with magic girls?
How can we call a guy "cute?!"
Some of those guys were obsessed
with Chinese themed characters!
Male
It was just a bunch of crossdressing freaks!
It was terrifying.
I thought I was going to die!
We'll give you an eternal lesson on "magical worlds!"
Things that Prez would be worried about?
Probably something to do with the Gremory family.
Would Akeno-san know something?
She's Prez's right-hand woman, so probably.
What's wrong?
For me to have just realized...
Yo!
Grayfia-san!
Everyone is here now.
M'lady. Shall I tell my story?
Truth be told...
Phoenix...
It's been a while since I last came to the human world.
I've come to see you,
my beloved, Rias.
Who is this guy?
This man is Rizer Phoenix-sama.
He is a pure-blood high class devil.
Also the head of the Phoenix family.
“Phoenix Clan”?
And the fiancée of the Gremory Clan’s heiress.
The heiress of the Gremory Clan?
Does that mean…?
Correct. He is also Rias-sama’s fiancée.
Fiancée?!
My, the tea that Rias' queen poured is quite nice.
I'm obliged.
This disgusting freak is Prez's fiancée?!
Will you cut it out,
Rizer?
I've told you already.
I will not marry you.
But Rias, I doubt your parents will let
such selfish statements affect anything.
I don't plan on crushing my family.
My parents may like their potential son-in-law,
but I will choose who I marry.
Pure-blooded devils drastically
decreased in numbers after the last war.
And that is a problem that affects all devils.
Both your father and Sazekusu-sama
decided this with the future in mind.
My father, my brother, and everyone else...
...rushes things too quickly.
I will not say it again, Rizer.
I will not marry you.
You know, I'm holding the flag of
the Phoenix family right now.
I'm not going to let you smear mud all over that flag.
Prez!
I'll drag you to Hades even if I have...
...to roast all your servants alive.
Please stop this at once.
Ojousama, Rizer-sama. I'm here
on behalf of Sazekusu-sama.
Therefore, I will not hold back if I must.
If the queen of Sazekusu-sama says that,
even I'll think twice.
My master had imagined that this would happen.
He's planned out a course of
action in case this happened.
Course of action?
What do you mean, Grayfia?
He suggests that if you can't settle this by normal means,
you two are to determine this by the rating game.
Rating game?
I've heard that before...
Oh, wasn't the student council
president saying something about that?
It's a game, much like chess, where two
masters will pit their servants against each other.
Chess?
This is why we servants are
assigned roles as evil pieces.
I see.
I've experienced the game plenty myself.
Not to mention quite a few wins.
Nevermind experience, you're not even qualified.
After all, only devils who've
reached maturity can participate.
Wait, then she'd be at a major disadvantage!
That's not her only disadvantage.
I'll confirm this, Rias, but...
...is everyone here, all your pieces?
What if it is?
I have fifteen servants.
In other words, I have a full set.
Y-You have fifteen beautiful girls?!
What a bastard...
What a man!
H-Hey, Rias.
Your servant's lamenting because of me...
His dream is a harem.
How gross.
I see.
Yuverura.
Yes, Rizer-sama?
Someone like you will never be able to do this.
Low-level devil-kun.
Shut it!
With that kind of attitude, you're going to be
with other women even after you marry Prez!
You womanizing asshole!
Do you say that while understanding your position?
Like I care!
My role is nothing but a servant!
Stop it, Issei.
I don't care if I'm anything more or less than that!
Issei...
Who needs a damned game?! I'll finish it right here!
Yes sir!
Issei-san!
Nera.
A small girl like this? I can't-
Issei-san!
Issei!
Issei! Hang on!
Prez.
S-Sorry.
I didn't think the one with the legendary
Boosted Gear would be someone so lame.
Fine. Let us settle this with a rating game.
It has been acknowledged.
I will definitely strike you down, Rizer.
I'll be waiting for it, my beloved Rias.
Let us meet at the game.

The 9th story ｢I started my training!｣
This is beautiful!
Now, let's go in and start right away!
Right away?!
Prez, you are an ogre!
You mean devil.
Hey, Kiba.
When we were fighting the fallen angels at the church,
It felt like you really had something against them.
You said...
I don't like fallen angels.
You could even say that I hate them.
Issei. You and Asia-san were both saved by Prez.
It's the same thing with us.
That's why we have to win for her.
Right?
Yeah! Of course!
Now, lesson one.
I said that but...
No, not that.
Don't focus on just the sword movement.
Focus on your enemy's movements as well.
As expected of a knight.
Come on.
Don't let your guard down!
Lesson two.
Gather the magic that's in your body. Concentrate it.
Focus your concentration.
Feel the wave of magic.
I did it!
My, my.
Maybe you do have a talent for magic, Asia.
Well, if Asia is getting stronger, then it's all good.
Amazing!
Once you get used to it, you can manipulate anything.
Fire, water, dirt, anything.
Asia-chan, please practice this next.
Yes.
Issei, you are to continue practicing on concentrating your magic.
O-Okay.
The trick to magic is imagery.
For now, you have to make what you imagine a reality.
Things that I imagine, huh?
Yes.
Yes, yes. Focus.
Focus.
What the hell am I thinking?!
What's the matter, Issei-kun?
N-Nothing! I'll do my best!
Lesson three.
Weak.
I'm not done yet!
That's rather reckless of you to charge in on a superior opponent like that.
I don't stand a chance against either Kiba or Koneko-chan!
My magic is nowhere near Asia's level.
There's nothing good about me!
Everyone has their own specialty.
Specialty? What's my specialty?
You're perverted.
Another one.
You give it your best all the time.
That's right!
I'll work harder, Koneko-chan!
Yes.
Lesson four.
Now, we're cooking...
With magic?
Just try it with your current skills.
Well, do you best.
Vegetables, please boil!
Even in Akeno-san's class, I struggled to make a grain of rice.
But even then, by just imagining her breasts, I can-
Potatoes are easy, too!
You're amazing, Issei-san!
Heh, I was just off my game earlier. This is my real power.
Amazing!
I feel like I've felt this before...
That's right! Back when
my Sacred Gear was first activated!
I get it!
I might...
be able to...
become invincible!
Issei-san...
What are we going to do with this...
The trick to magic is imagery.
For now, you have to make what you imagine a reality.
Everyone has their own specialty.
You're perverted.
You're acting like a lecher.
That's not true! Haha!
Issei.
Yes?
Working hard all day today, how was it?
Yeah. I was the weakest one here.
That's true. That's for sure.
But, Asia's healing and your Boosted Gear are extremely important.
The enemy realizes this, so make sure
you don't drag down the team.
At the very least, you ought to be strong enough to escape without harm.
U-Understood.
Yes.
That's right. It's my fault that Asia was dragged into all of this.
At the very least, I have to become strong enough to save her!
Now that we're done eating, let's all take a bath.
B-Bath?!
Oh, do you want to peak at us while we're nude?
Do you want to come in with us, then? I don't mind.
Akeno, how about you?
I'd like to try washing your back.
Asia. You'd be fine with it too, right?
What about you, Koneko?
No.
Well, I guess that's a no then.
I'll punish you if you peak.
Outdoor baths are the best!
It'd be ideal if everyone's exhaustion can be cleansed away with this.
Without a doubt, it will.
You're fine.
U-Um...
Issei-kun, what's the point of doing that?
Shut it! This is part of my training!
Did Issuei-kun figure out how to use x-ray vision?
What's my specialty?
You're perverted.
That's right! That's my speciality!
My...
specialty!

I see. So it went as I thought.
Yes.
That's just like her.
I don't think she has any chance...
I doubt she does.
You knew that...
I simply gave her the option to do so.
The decision itself was made by her.
She made it as the head of the Gremory family.
Right?
Yes.
Asia. Asia.
Issei-san?!
I'm sorry for bothering you so late at night,
but you're the only one I can ask!
Y-Yes?
I should be able to do it!
I should definitely be able to do it!
Issei-san...
Asia,
I want to borrow your clothes.
Issei-san, you had such a serious face on!
What are you doing?
That's right. We devils and fallen angels, even the god that rules the heavens,
were once brought together in a time long forgotten in the annals of history.
It was an enormous three-way war.
In the end, nothing was resolved and many simply lost their lives.
The war was eventually put to an end.
Devils have an extremely long lifespan.
In return, the birthrates are minimal.
Therefore, the very concept of war is dangerous to devils.
During this war, a majority of devils were...
...exterminated by a legion of 72 pure fallen angels.
My family, the Gremorys.
Souna's family, the Shitoris.
Raiser's family, the Phoenixes.
We're said to be the survivors of this legion.
This is the reason why devils make contracts
with humans and increase their families.
That's how the rating game was born.
Through the game, families would gauge each others strengths.
At the same time, the head of the family
would also be able to gauge their own strength.
Right now, the game is large enough to
have its own ceremonies and such.
Let's take a break for now.
I'm sure everyone's tired.
I'll pour some tea.
I'll help too.
Asia!
Sorry about last night.
No, no. It was amazing!
To think-
Shh. Don't tell anyone about this.
It's our secret?
It's still not complete and I can't use it in action yet.
Understood. I'll work with you until you complete your special move!
"Special"?
It's a secret!
Oh right, Asia. I'd like
to hear your story about being a sister.
Okay.
The specialty items we exorcists have are these two.
One is this. Holy water.
As you are all devils, please be extra careful
not to come into contact with this.
What happens if we come into contact with it?
Something terrible will happen!
"Terrible"? The uncertainty makes it all the more scary.
Asia. The same applies to you.
You're a devil.
You're right.
I don't know if it'll be of any use, but
I'll teach you how to make it later.
And the other item,
the Bible.
I've always been reading this since I was a child.
However, if I try to read anything out of it now, I get a blinding headache.
It's troublesome!
You are a devil, after all.
You are a devil.
Devil.
Too bad you're a devil.
But this is so beautiful!
H-Headache!
Lord, please forgive me for not being able to read!
I can't!
I seriously can't tell if she's doing it on purpose or serious.
But I don't have anywhere near the potential as she does.
Issei.
Prez?
What are you doing this late at night?
Perfect timing. Let's talk.
Is that a plan?
Yeah. Though a manual like this doesn't really do much.
That's not true. You're trying so hard!
However, my opponent will be a Phoenix.
You should know.
A bird of fire.
They possess the same name as a great beast.
They survived the legion of fallen angels.
Finally, they possess the same power as the beast.
Immortality.
Immortality? Does that exist?!
Well, more like unrivaled.
Even if they're injured,
they heal right away.
Raiser's war records are impressive to say the least.
However,
he did some strange things.
He purposely lost.
The Phoenixes suddenly grew in numbers and
strength as soon as the rating games began.
It's to be expected, though.
If they're immortal, they won't lose.
I'm sorry.
For what?
If I hadn't acted like that to Raiser,
we wouldn't be going through this.
Rather, you helped us by speeding things up.
My father, knowing I would lose, planned out this rating game.
Saying it was just chess... it's like a swindle.
Why are you denying the marriage?
I am the daughter of the Gremory family.
Regardless of where I go,
I will always be a Gremory devil.
If I married, the line of Gremorys would end.
I'm sure pride plays a role in this,
but if I am to marry I'd want to have someone
who loves me not because I'm a Gremory,
but because I am Rias.
It's selfish, but I want to hold onto this dream.
I don't care about anything like that. I still
love you for who you are, Prez.
It's true that I'm completely clueless
with all the politics behind this,
but the Prez that's standing in front
of me right now is the best to me!
Did I say something strange?
It's nothing.
If we're going to fight, we're going to win.
I heard from Kiba that you were
known as the Princess of Ruins.
I heard you were such a genius that people
called you the Princess of Obliteration.
To think that your supposed fiance is a guy like that...
You're wrong.
That power and strength I have wasn't
some gift from the heavens.
It's proof of the efforts that the Gremorys have put in.
It's something that I, a Gremory, have earned.
That's why I won't lose. I can't lose. I must win.
Prez, you're definitely amazing.
In comparison, I'm good-for-nothing.
Issei...
I've come to a painful realization since coming here.
I'm the most useless here.
Even if I possess some great sacred
gear, it's useless if I have it.
Yet, I'm always the one to recklessly charge in.
In the end, I always cause you trouble.
I'm...
I'm...
good for nothing!
You need self-confidence, Issei.
It's fine. I'll give that self-confidence to you.
Self-confidence...
That's right.
So, rest for now.
Rest your body and soul.
I'll stay by your side until you can fall asleep.
It's okay, Issei. I will definitely give you the self-confidence.
Use your boosted gear, Issei.
But you told me not to use it...
Only without my permission.
Yuuto, are you okay with being the target?
Sure thing.
I won't hold back!
Boosted Gear!
Again!
Boost!
Again!
Boost!
Not yet!
Boost!
One more time!
Boost!
More.
Boost. Boost. Boost!
He's powered up 12 times now.
Stop.
Issei, do you understand now?
Before now, you would never have been able to do this.
You're showing signs of improvement.
I get it now...
Start.
Let's go! Boosted Gear!
Explosion!
That's?
With that aura, Issei is able to fight
with a set level for a certain time.
Yuuto!
Issei, fire a concentration of magic!
This is all...
Fire!
Why you...!
Oh my.
The mountain...
is gone.
T-This is my powe~.
Issei-san.
Looks like you've tired yourself out.
Yuuto, how was he?
I was genuinely surprised.
I'd even say it was on the level of a high level devil.
Issei,
your strenght will tip this game in our favor.
Believe in us. But most importantly, in yourself.
Believe in everyone... and myself.
Issei.
I still love you for who you are, Prez...
You're the best for me, Rias-senpai!

It doesn't matter if our opponent is the Phoenix.
We'll show them how...
...powerful the Gremory's are.
I can't lose!
Issei-san, can I come in?
Come on in.
Asia?
That outfit...
I was wondering if I should wear my sister's outfit, but...
the Prez told me to wear what I feel most comfortable with.
Asia, you look great in that outfit.
Um, could I sit by you?
Sure thing.
Asia...
A scary battle is going to start soon, right?
Yeah.
However... if you're by my side, I feel at ease.
Can I always be by your side?
Yeah, always.
It's time! Wake up! I mean-

The 10th story ｢Beginning of the Decisive Battle!｣
As expected,
everyone seems to be calm...
Pardon me.
Good evening, Souna.
Welcome.
The student council president and vice-president?
Why are they here?
In a rating game, a fight between two
families are relayed by a third party.
These two are the third party.
Oh.
We volunteered for the job.
After all, this is Rias's first rating game.
I'll make sure I put up a good fight to
show you I'm worthy of being your rival.
Are your preparations complete?
Yes. We're ready whenever.
When the time comes, you will be transported
by this summoning circle to the battleground.
Battleground?
It's a special area created for rating games.
The place is disposable, so you can
do anything you want to it.
A-Anything... ?
I'll be returning to the student counsel room for now.
I wish you the best of luck, Rias.
Thank you. But make sure you do this fairly.
Of course.
It's just, I don't think that person is fit to be your partner.
By the way, this match will be overseen by
the lord of the devils, "Lucifer."
I see.
My brother...
B-Brother? Did I hear that correctly?
You heard correctly. Prez's brother
is the lord of the devils.
Wait, Prez, your brother is the lord of the devils?!
Yes.
Demi-gods in power, Crimson Satan and Sirzechs "Lucifer,"
the latter being Prez's brother, are the ones in charge right now.
After the previous lord of the devils was killed
in the Great War, Sirzechs-sama took command.
So that's why Rias-sama is the next heir-in-line.
I see.
I'm the daughter of the Gremory household.
My family's name has always been a burden.
It's time.
Let's go.
Huh?
Nothing's changed.
The transportation failed? Is it my fault?
Everyone.
I, Greyfia, the maid of the Gremorys, will be the referee...
...for today's match between the Gremory and the Phoenix.
After consulting both parties, we have decided that...
...today's battleground will be a replica of the school which Rias-sama attends.
A replica?
Look outside
It's the sky!
This is an illusionary space.
They've literally copied the school onto here.
I-Is there any limit to a devil's power?
There're two parties, where you're at right now is your headquarters.
Rias-sama's headquarters is the
Occult Research Club's room.
Tsubaki.
Yes.
Raiza-sama's headquarters...
will be the principal's room.
Pawns can be promoted if they successfully
infiltrate the enemy's headquarters.
So basically, I just need to sneak into their headquarters
and then I can become a piece as powerful as a Queen!
Oh my, it's not that easy.
On the other hand, if they infiltrate us, they can get a promotion as well.
It's best if you make defending the
headquarters your prime objective.
You're right.
What is this?
We'll be communicating with this on the battlefield.
So it works like a communication device?
Now, let the game begin.
It'll be an easy job for you, so don't hesitate to crush them.
This farce means nothing unless we
crush that red-haired girl's inflated ego.
The enemy's headquarters is heavily guarded;
the shortest route is to go through the school yard, but...
We'll be in the plain sight of the enemy.
Yes, the risk will be too high.
What about taking a flank through the track
and field grounds behind the school?
I guessing they have a counter for that as well.
They probably placed an agile knight and a powerful rook in this club house.
Though it's a standard tactic, it's most likely a move that they'll make.
Prez,
what about this gymnasium that
connects the two areas together?
Wouldn't it be wise to secure it first as it'll provide
a forward position for us to attack from?
In chess terms, the gymnasium would be like the center of the board.
Whoever secures it first will have an attacking advantage.
I think it's decided.
Since it's indoors, I think the rook's strength
will be more useful than the knight's speed.
Fighting is difficult, isn't it?
We just need to trust Prez and carry out our orders.
You're right.
First, we need to set up a defensive line.
Yuuto, Koneko. Could you set some traps in the forest?
Yes.
Roger.
Come, Shiro.
We'll get going, now.
Akeno, once the traps are set, could you cast a pseudo-reality over the area?
Understood.
U-Um, what about us?
Asia will stay here with me because of her healing ability.
If you fall, it'll be very bad for us.
U-Understood.
Issei.
Y-Yes?
You rest your head here for now.
I-Is that the legendary "lap pillow"?!
Hurry up.
T-Thank you!
What a feeling. So soft and comfortable.
Yet, a firm reassuring feel.
We're in the middle of an important game, but this is too special!
What are you crying for?
I'm so happy that you're giving me a lap pillow that my tears wont stop!
I'm glad I was born!
You exaggerate things. This is nothing.
Really?!
Wipe your nose already.
I'm going to unlock some of the power I gave you.
What?
DxD
Hadena Fansubs
High School
Let's move on.
Now, go.
Power... from the depth of my body...
To make a contract with you, I had to use eight pawns worth of slots, right?
Y-Yeah.
But your newly contracted body wouldn't have been able to handle the power.
That's why I put several layers of restrictions on it.
And now I've just unlocked one of those layers.
Then this power flowing through me...
That's the power you possess.
In order to utilize it, you needed the Boosted Gear and a body powerful enough to withstand it.
Of course, you're still lacking in some areas.
So that's what all those training session's were for.
I can't believe I called her an ogre in my heart!
I'm terrible! Absolutely terrible!
I never knew the Prez thought so much about it.
Lord, forgive me for these jealous thoughts I've had!
Ow!
You have to understand, Issei. Even if the
opponents are girls, you have to defeat them.
You mustn't go easy on them; because they won't go easy on you.
Understood! I'll definitely make sure you win, Prez!
I'll be waiting. My cute Issei.
Prez, can you hear me?
Loud and clear.
The preparations are complete.
Ow!
I'll explain the plan, now.
Rias-sama has made a move.
Due to her lack of pieces, any further action to strengthen her defense is futile.
Assuming so, they'll be making swift, deft attacks.
Once you enter the gym, a battle will be imminent, understood?
Follow the plan.
Understood.
Yuuto, are you ready?
No problem.
Akeno, provide support when necessary.
Got it, Prez.
Operation, start!
My adored servants!
Our opponent isn't just the Phoenix, but the feared,
Raizer Phoenix!
Regardless, we will defeat him!
Issei-san and everyone, do your best!
Man, they're thorough.
Enemy.
We know you're there, servants of Gremory.
I guess there's no point in trying to be sneaky.
So it's the rook and the overly-excited pawn,
even though you were wiped out.
That girl!
Mira, a pawn.
I'm the rook, Shue.
Niru! I'm a pawn!
Same! Name's, Neru!
That rook's level is extremely high.
What do you mean?
Based on her battle strength, I'd say she's at a queen level.
Seriously?
We're at a disadvantage from the start. But we've gotta do what we've gotta do.
Boost!
Yes, sir!
I'll go for the rook. Issei-senpai,
please take care of the pawns.
Even if you make them chase you around.
Don't worry about me.
I have a chance at winning this.
Let's go!
As I expected, they came from the center.
How are the deployed forces doing?
Good.
Our pawns Shuri, Mareo, and Yuren, are sneaking in.
are sneaking in.
This fog is getting thick.
Traps? Not the least bit intimidating.
This is like a child's game.
How cute, a novice probably set them.
Koneko-chan!
Not ba-
What the hell are you?
A servant of Rias-sama.
Stop running!
Let's cut you in half!
Kids like you shouldn't be saying that!
Or rather, I don't want to be cut in half!
What?
I've managed to evade!
Cut! Cut!
I can do this!
Stop dodging!
Why won't you just get cut?!
I trained hard too, you know! I can't just lose like this!
Let's do this! Boosted Gear!
First, you two!
One!
Two!
Three!
I-I lost?
Ow!
But now, I've cleared all the conditions.
If we lost to this guy,
Raiza-sama will yell at us!
We won't forgive you!
We're going to dismember you!
Now!
Take this!
My special move!
Dress!
Break!
No!
How's that?!
I just keep imagining a girl with no clothes!
Yes, I concentrate deeply on the image and utilize my magic to make my imagination come true!
This is my special move! Dress Break!
Vulgar.
He probably started the spell as
soon as he touched the girls.
Though you have to give him points for originality.
Sick!
Pervert!
You're any woman's enemy!
Asia!
I-I did it!
I-Issei-san?
T-this...
I'm sorry, Asia!
One more time!
Okay! I'll go get changed!
Y-You did it!
No, it can't be just the outer layers!
I'm sorry to make you do this so much!
It's fine! I have a lot of old clothes!
Issei-san! Keep trying!
Thank you so much, Asia!
I've misjudged you.
K-Koneko-chan!
The enemy rook! As expected of Koneko-chan!
Koneko, Issei, status?
Prez! Both Koneko-chan and I are safe!
In fact,
we're both quite fine.
That's good to hear. Akeno's preparations have been completed.
Proceed with the plan.
Are you planning on running? We've yet to finish!
Are you running without finishing us off?!
Got you.
Three of Raiza-sama's pawns have been taken out.
A-Amazing.
Akeno's also called the Priestess of Thunder.
Her power is certainly worthy of the name.
The Priestess of Thunder, I see.
If she punished me, I'd definitely die.
To use an important location as a trap to take out enemies...
I can't imagine it's the first time
she's done something this bold.
As expected of Rias.
But with this, it's certain that Raiza-sama will show his serious side.
Yes.
The scary part is yet to come.
The enemy's side still has more pieces.
It'll take some time until Akeno can release her powerful attack.
While we wait for Akeno's magic to charge up, we'll push forward.
Now, move on towards your next objective.
Our next objective is...
We rendezvous with Yuuto-senpai at the track and field grounds.
There, we'll wipe out all opposition.
Is Kiba...
...okay out there?
Do they really think these traps will keep us at bay?
That must be the enemy's headquarters.
What is this?
Too bad.
You won't be able to leave now.
You've entered a force field created by our Queen.
Damn it, we fell for the trap.
You shouldn't take us so lightly.
I don't want to make you feel bad, but do you really think you can win against the three of us?
Would you like to find out?
Well, knowing him,
he probably has a smile on his face while doing his job.
Koneko-chan, let's go.
Don't touch me.
Oh come on. I'd never use that on an ally!
Even then, it's a disgusting move.
It seems she really hates me now.
Wait up Koneko-chan!
Koneko-chan!
Koneko! What happened to her?!
Issei! Answer me!
Rias. Don't underestimate me.
I am, Raiza Phoenix.

The 11th story ｢High Praises During the Decisive Battle!｣
One of Rias-sama's rooks has retired.
Damn it, how dare you do that to Koneko-chan!
Come down here! I'll be your opponent!
Calm down, Issei.
Those who are out of the game,
will be teleported to the real world,
and will be treated for their wounds.
Koneko is technically not dead.
Stay cool.
But!
Give up, boy.
No matter how much you cry,
you will never be able to defeat us.
Oh my!
Akeno-san!
Issei-kun,
leave this place to me and hurry to the next.
You don't need to worry about me.
I will dish out everything I have to avenge Koneko-chan.
Got it, Akeno-san.
For once, I wanted to have a match
with you, Priestess of Lightning.
Oh my, that is an honor,
Rubbish Queen.
Three of Riser-sama's Pawns have retired.
All three of them?
Hey.
Oh, it's you?
The three members just now...
Thanks to Akeno-san's magical barrier,
it became a lot easier.
For now, Riser-sama has nine pieces,
and Rias-sama has five pieces left.
We can not let our guards down yet.
I'm sorry Kiba, Koneko-chan was...
I heard.
She doesn't usually express herself much,
but she put a lot of effort today.
She must've had her regrets.
Lets win this for sure.
Of course.
Yuuto, Issei, can you hear me?
Both I and Asia will give the enemy's headquarters a surprise attack.
So distract them as much as
possible, and buy us some time.
A surprise attack?
I have no choice.
I had plans to take on the offensive
after Akeno had recovered,
but the enemy decided to attack the queen directly.
However Prez, for the King to enter
enemy headquarters is a risk too big.
The enemy would think so as well.
That is what I'm after.
No matter how immortal Phoenix's physical body may be,
their hearts are not.
If we were give them a fatal blow,
we can win against Riser.
I'll directly tear Riser's heart apart!
If that's the case,
as the Occult Research Club's all men combination,
let's put up a show they won't ever forget.
Hey, we know you're hiding anyway!
Let's have a face to face battle!
I am the knight under Riser-sama's command.
The name is Caramine.
I could only think of you as fools to want
to have a frontal battle.
But, I like fools like you very much.
I am the knight under Rias-sama's command,
Kiba Yuuto.
I was looking forward for a Knight on Knight battle.
Well said, Rias Gremory's knight!
Wow... More importantly, hasn't
my part disappeared just now?
That's not true at all.
This doesn't change a thing.
All she's thinking about are swords, swords, and swords.
She even had an apathetic face
when five pieces were sacrificed...
Jeez, how irritating she is.
And just when I finally found a handsome looking guy,
I can't believe he is also a swordsman freak.
Really, I'm out of luck.
So they mobilized all the remaining pieces.
The Prez's prediction was right on the spot.
That aside, isn't Rias-sama's
choice in men a bit weird?
You've got a cute face but terrible a personality, eh?
Boosted Gear!
Oh my, I'm sorry.
I won't fight you.
What?
Isabella.
I am Isabella.
I'm a Rook under Riser-sama's command.
Well then, let's do this. Rias Gremory's...
...pawn!
Hey,
what's with her?
What does she mean by "I won't fight"?
She may be participating as a bishop,
but she is only there to watch the battle.
What's with that?
Her name is Revel Phoenix.
Phoenix?
She is a part of the Phoenix family,
she's Riser-sama's little sister.
His little sister?
You know, a lot of people get
jealous if you have a little sister.
Well I'm not into little sisters,
I just made my sister into a part of my devils family.
That is what it is.
That birdy bastard!
That guy really is a perverted
idiot!
But I get why you would want
a little sister in your harem...
You sure are better than I expected.
Well,
I didn't train with Koneko-chan
and Kiba for nothing, you know!
Even though, I have no choice but to
hold out until this thing powers up.
Yes, Sir!
This is the fifth time it boosted.
This may be good enough to fight a Pawn with,
but it's not enough to take on a Rook!
Oh, you've changed since the last
time you were defeated by Mira.
Seems like Rias Gremory has raised you quite well.
That's right. I've been trained in
very harsh environments by Prez!
I am President Rias's servant!
That is why I can't lose.
I will defeat you for the sake of Prez!
I've been waiting for you,
my beloved Rias.
The Holy Riser has...
Unfortunately that attack has no effect on me.
Then how about this?
Iced sword!
You, having two sacred gears!
No problem!
We, the Phoenix Flame Squad,
rule the flames, the wind, and lives!
I won't lose...
...to you!
You bastard, how many sacred gears do you have?
It's not like I have an abundance sacred gears,
rather, I just created them.
Demonic Sword Creation: Sword Birth.
In other words,
I can...
...make any demonic sword appear upon my will.
This is...!
Wow...
He has that kind of power...
You,
don't look away when you're fighting!
Dammit, it should be about time...
Yes, Sir!
Here it comes!
Special Dragon Technique!
Dragon Shot!
Crap...
Even though I restrain my power...
This is dangerous...
I must defeat that sacred gear here and now, or else...
Like I would let you!
You think you landed a hit on me!?
Take it off!
Dress Break!
What the hell is this?
I stored it a new folder in my brain, and gave it a name!
I have stored it in my brain!
All right, let's do this!
Isabella!
One of Riser-sama's
rooks have retired.
I won!
But that was a cruel technique you used.
No, it's a fearsome technique towards a girl.
I saw that for the time as well.
How do I put it...
I'm sorry that our Issei-kun is a pervert.
Hey you! Don't go on apologizing to the enemy, Kiba!
However,
Hey you perverted boy over there...
Can you see what that is?
Prez!
Hadena Fansubs

Isn't a bit too early to go head on.
So they saw through our moves.
I assume you saw right through me.
Virgins must not look down on the experienced, Rias.
As usual,what a graceless person.
Ruin Princess, Twilight Healing,
Priestess of Lightning,
Sword Birth,
and Boosted Gear, these are some fine names lined up here.
But we are the Immortal Phoenix.
We are immortal!
Do you now understand how
much despair this will bring you all?
Ni and Li,
~Nyaa~
~Nyaa~
these pawns are a lot stronger than they look.
Boosted Gear!
You are the worst guy!
To let lower half of your body rules over your brain!
You are just a pervert!
Finish him, Sieris!
Damn, this is bad.
Issei-kun!
Prez...
I wish you would entertain me a bit more.
We're having a premarital sexual relationship after all.
Who in hell!
Prez!
I'm all right, concentrate on your
enemy rather than worrying about me.
But...!
I believe in you, Issei!
The power of Rias Gremory's servants...
Show them it!
Exactly. I am Prez's servant!
He blocked Sieris's sword,
with his arm?
I don't have to worry about anything.
For the sake of the Prez, I will
defeat you all!
What?
Hey Red Dragon Emperor, answer to my call!
Grant me your powers!
Dragon Booster!
I need more, answer to my feelings even more!
Boosted Gear!
Dragon Booster Sacred Evolution!
What the!
I-It changed!
I never thought you were this good, Priestess of Lightning.
But your magical power has already been depleted...
There's no need to worry.
I will recover if I rest a bit.
I wonder if you have that kind of leisure.
That's...
You fell for it.
I see, this is my new power!
Kiba!
Release your Sacred Gear as well!
Release?
Do it fast!
Sword Birth!
No!
It's my... loss.
Riser-sama's two Pawns, two Knights,
and a Bishop have retired.
He boosted the Knight's abilities with his Sacred Gear...
A new power...
...given to him by the Sacred.
It's called Boosted Gear's Gift!
Rias-sama's only queen has retired.
Akeno-san!
Akeno!
Akeno-san has...
Seems you've lost one of the pieces
you were so haughty about.
I still have Yuuto and Issei.
If you still have them, that is.
I could never have imagined Akeno-san getting defeated.
Kiba!
Kiba!
Taken.
You again!
Rias-sama's
knight has retired.
Yuuto!
Resign now, Rias!
Who would!
You still don't get it, do you?
You along with that bishop
and your lovely pawn are just going to get hurt.
Issei-san...
You sure were late Yubelluna.
Just like the rumors, the Queen was quite strong.
Still, I had to use this thing's power to win.
A win is a win after all.
You are after all, the most reliable person around.
Well then.
What is that bottle?
Phoenix's Tears.
Phoenix household's treasure
that can instantly heal any kind of wound.
Is that even possible?
Oh my, you do know that only two items
are allowed in the game, right?
You do have a Bishop with Twilight Healing, anyway.
Since only my family can produce
this, it's exchange rate is high.
The Immortal Tears, since the start of the Rating game,
this item has brought the Phoenix
family their wealth and glory.
W-Wait, are you ignoring me?
Promotion, give me the power of the Queen.
Please wait for me.
Prez, I'll definitely...
...rescue you!
Prez, Hyoudo Issei...
...has come to your aid!
Issei!
Issei-san!
Should I take care of the bishop and pawn?
Nope, I'll take them head on.
I think they would approve of that as well.
Don't mess around with us.
You will have to defeat me first!
Just resign, Rias.
You're already done for.
I knew this would happen. It's a checkmate.
Just shut it Riser.
Fixed intentions? Motives?
Don't make me laugh.
I'm still in good health, as the King of the opponent side.
Seems I have no choice. Give her that.
Yes.
Asia... ?
You were beaten so hard, and you still stand here.
I promised, right?
Yes.
Thanks, you are our lifeline.
Please stand back.
Asia, Issei!
Are you all right?
Asia is...
Unhurt. She probably fainted because of the shock.
Sorry, who would've thought that the
boy would protect her with his body.
I don't mind.
For the time being, we've sealed the Twilight Healing.
You bastard!
You got hit by my direct attack
and yet, you're still standing?
Due to the defensive power of the queen,
you were saved because you were promoted.
Prez, the match is resuming, right?
Yes.
I'm an idiot, so I don't understand tactics or moves,
but I can still fight!
I can still fight until my fists crumble!
Nicely said, Issei.
Let's defeat Riser together!
Yes, Prez!
Wait for me Asia, we'll definitely win.
And we'll return home in one piece.
Boost.
Yes, Sir!
First
Boost.
Yes, Sir!
Second
Boost.
Yes, Sir!
Issei!
Unlike other Sacred Gears, Boosted Gear
places a stronger strain on the body of its owner.
On the other hand, it's almost a miracle that
he was able to use his powers so many times
and came this far at the same time.
He received a direct hit where his
magical power was almost depleted.
Issei!
His body has already crossed its limits.
Seems it's over.
Riser!
Rias!
You only have little magical powers
left to perform these attacks.
How about you just obediently
accept your defeat and resign?
Who would?
I'm all right, Prez.
I will win, no matter what.
I will become the strongest pawn.
I promised that to you.
You trained me this far.
You absurd fool!
I can still fight,
I will keep my promise!
Issei!
I can still fight!
Since I am your Pawn!
I can still fight.
I will win.
Issei, fall back! Fall back!
I...
Issei, why don't you listen to my command?
I...
As long I see you smile,
That doesn't change a thing, I love you, Prez.
You are the only one for me, Rias Senpai.
Issei. You're...
Unpleasant.
You are only a servant.
Did you think you can win against me!
Riser, what are you doing?
What is it? I'm just going to burn him alive.
To the point where you can't heal him anymore.
Since a death in a Rating Game is seen as an accident.
You!
You bastard!
Issei!
I beg you, please stop it, Riser!
It's my loss.
I am resigning.
Check-
-mate.
Prez...
Why?
Rias-sama's resign has been confirmed.
The winner is Riser Phoenix-sama.

Even though this is an engagement party,
why am I wearing a wedding dress?

Who are you?
The power that you possess is abnormal.
That voice... I've heard it...
You will never become strong if you
continue as you are now.
That's right... in my dream, you...
You are an abnormal being who
possesses a dragon within you.
Don't disappoint me.
The white one will appear soon.
White one? Who's that?
He'll appear before you sooner or later.
After all, you are fated to battle with this person.
You need to continue growing stronger for that day.
I will always be here to grant you the power you need.
What sacrifices you make will not go unrewarded.
All you have to do is showing them
the true power of a dragon.
Dragon? You!
I'm Welsh Dragon, the Red Dragon Emperor, Ddraig.
Ddraig?
I’m the one who reside in your left arm
Eh?!
Huh? Why was I...
The 12th story ｢I came to keep my promise!｣
It seems you've awoken.
Greyfia-san!
What happened to the match? What about Prez?!
The match ended with Raiser-sama's victory.
We lost?
Rias-sama forfeited the game.
Prez forfeited?!
Correct.
Impossible...
Prez would never accept defeat!
Prez wouldn't... !
It's because Raiser-sama tried to kill you.
I don't remember clearly what happened back there.
You kept standing up and lunging at Raiser-sama.
You did well, Issei.
You can stop now. You've done your part.
Thanks for all the work, Issei.
So, that's what happened.
It's all my fault, even after I made those promises.
I just collapsed so pathetically in front of her.
The others?!
What about the others?!
Asia-san, by order of Rias-sama,
stayed here to take care of you.
The others are with Rias-sama at Hades.
With her... ?
For the wedding party.
The one for Raiser-sama and Rias-sama.
Prez...
As Rias, I want to marry someone who will love me.
I want to keep that small dream of mine.
I'm sorry, Prez.
Aim to become the strongest pawn.
You can do it, my cute servant.
Become stronger, Issei.
I wasn't able to become stronger...
I'm weak. Why am I so weak?
It seems you aren't satisfied.
Lady Rias only did as she should have done.
Besides, she probably wanted the match to end by then.
I understand. I know that.
Even then, I don't want to see Prez accepting defeat.
I don't want to see her getting engaged
to someone just because of her parents.
Especially to that bastard!
You are truly an interesting person.
Huh?
Over the years, I've met many devils, but...
you're the first one to honestly portray your feelings.
Sirzechs-sama also thought you were interesting.
A magic circle?
With this, you can get to the engagement party.
Are you telling me to attend it?
"If you want my sister back, barge into the hall."
Those are Sirzechs-sama's words.
The one in the back, please use it when you take
back my Lady. It will definitely be useful to you.
I don't need to think about this.
Issei-san?
Asia?
What happened?!
I'm so glad, so relieved to see you're doing okay.
I performed all the treatments I knew on you,
but you still didn't wake up for two days!
I was starting to think you might never wake up!
I'm sorry. I caused you trouble again.
It's fine. As long as you're better, I'm glad.
Listen, Asia.
Yes?
I'll be heading to Prez's side soon.
Huh?!
It's not to celebrate, right?
Yeah, it's to save her.
I'll go, too!
Asia... you mustn't.
Asia, you stay here.
No! I want to fight alongside you!
Now that I can use magical power well enough!
I don't want to just be protected all the time!
It's fine. I'm just going to lightly hit Raiser and-
It's not fine!
You're going to get bloody, pummelled, beaten,
and go through all that pain.
I don't want you to go through
that or see you like that again.
I won't die. I promise.
Hey, I was alive when I saved you, right?
Then, promise me.
Promise?
Definitely come back with Prez!
Of course. I want you to help me with one thing, though.
You're the only one I can ask you.
Understood. If you tell me to, I'll do it.
Thank you.
Hey, you can hear me, can't you?
I need to talk to you.
Come out, Red Dragon Emperor, Ddraig!
What is it? Why do you need me?
I want to make a deal with you.
This is just an engagement party.
Yet, this dress makes me look
like I'm at the actual wedding.
Exactly.
Raiser-sama, you mustn't. Males are prohibited from here.
Don't be so stiff. I'm the one hosting this.
The leading actress in a wedding
is a bride after all. Pardon me!
I'm not your bride yet.
What's up with this outfit, anyway?
It's fine.
It's fine. It's quite appealing to Hades for
the Phoenix and Gremory's to finally connect.
With that outfit, it's like you're submitting
yourself to the whole thing, too!
Don't worry.
The actual wedding will have a dress that can't compare ready for you.
I'll have an outfit as beautiful as
the outspread wings of a Phoenix!
The more I hear him talk, the more I realize
how bad his tastes are. Fitting for his family.
Issei!
Issei!!
Prez... I won't lose...
Prez! I promise, I'll let you win this!
Even though you can't even properly use your magic and
you barely have any experience on the battlefield,
you still fought with your all for me.
You're an idiot, fighting until you end up in this condition.
No. I'm the silly one.
I almost lost this child.
My cute, precious, so precious...
Issei...
Rias-sama, it's almost time.
Can you believe it? My brother
acquired a wife from a rating game.
Of course, the result of the match was obvious from...
...the beginning, but it sure was entertaining.
It's a bit frustrating we can't debate her statement.
They must have forgotten they were being relayed.
President Souna!
The end result is undeniable, but the battle was long and difficult.
No, the battle too, was undeniably long and difficult.
We thank you, but no need for the consolations.
It probably hasn't ended yet.
That's what we think.
It hasn't ended yet.
People of Hades, I thank everyone here on the behalf of the Phoenix.
The reason why I called everyone here today is because I, Raiser Phoenix,
and the head of the Gremory family,
Rias Gremory are going to get engaged today.
This will be a historic event for all demons to remember.
Now, allow me to introduce my empress, Rias Gremory!
Issei?!
Prez!!
You bastard, do you know where-
I'm Hyoudou Issei of the Ocult Research Club
and Rias Gremory-sama's virginity is mine!
Y-You bastard!!
What is that guy saying?
Apprehend him!
Shall we join the party?
Let's.
Agreed.
Issei-kun, go. Leave this to us.
You're late.
Kiba, Koneko-chan!
Oh my, so you decided to show up.
Akeno-san!
Go ahead, Issei-kun.
Got it!
What's going on?
Rias-dono. What is the meaning of this?
It's something I set up.
Who is that?
Onii-sama?!
W-Wait, that means...
Sirzechs Lucifer-sama?!
T-The Devil Lord!
Sirzechs-sama, you say you set it up but-
Raiser-kun. I was given the privilege of
watching your rating game in-depth.
I can't say I enjoyed watching you teach
my inexperienced younger sister.
Were you particularly dissatisfied with the match?
No, no. What I meant is that the whole game
is not worthy to be called a rating game.
In this occasion, circumstances are circumstances.
You don't want to disgrace
the Old Families' names, right?
Huh!
This is my cute sister's long-awaited engagement party.
Might as well make it memorable.
Hey, boy.
I was thinking I'd like to see the power of
the dragon you possess with my own eyes.
I had you brought here by Greyfia.
I see, now.
In other words...
A match between the Dragon and Phoenix.
How about livening up the place with
a battle between the legendaries?
Hadena Fansubs

High School
O-Onii-sama?
I guess you're not called the Devil Lord
for nothing, to think of such an interesting event.
Dragon wielding boy.
Y-Yes?
Won't you show the power you possess to everyone here?
I will.
Issei, don't.
Shall I show my final flames before the main event?
Dragon wielding boy.
What would you like as your reward if you win?
Sirzechs-sama, you can't be serious
about giving a low-level devil a reward!
Regardless of whether he's low-level or high-level, he's still a devil.
I asked you to do a favor. It's only natural
I reward you. What do you want?
Money? Perhaps an unrivaled beauty?
Come, tell me!
Prez...
No, I want Rias Gremory-sama back!
Now, let's have you two start.
Prez, I'll settle this in ten seconds!
Are you saying you can defeat Onii-sama in ten seconds?
You must be joking!
Allow me to shut that mouth of yours in five, then.
I'll make sure you never open it up again.
Prez, permission to use Promotion?!
Issei... what are you planning?
Promotion! Queen!
It's pointless!
Prez!
I have no talent for the sword like Kiba.
I'm no magical genius like Akeno-san.
I have no monstrous strength like Koneko-chan.
I have no great abilities such as Asia' healing abilities.
But even then, I'll become the
strongest pawn there ever was!
If it's for you, I'll defeat anything!
Shine, Over Boost!
Welsh Dragon!
Over Boost!
This is the power of Heavenly Dragon! Balance Breaker! Boosted Gear Stalemate!
Balance Breaker?!
Is that forbidden?!
Apparently it’s the “Ominous Forbidden Technique”!
I want you to make a deal with me.
It sounds interesting. Are you ready for the worst?
Shut it. Are you going to make the deal or not?
I told you. Your sacrifices won't go unrewarded.
But remember, you only get ten counts.
Past that, your body won't hold.
It's fine. I can knock him down in that time.
Ten!
Over here!
Nine!
What is this speed and power?
You're one hell of an annoying brat!
You're nothing but a monster, you punk!
I'll show you the power of fire from a Phoenix!
Burn!
Eight!
There's no way I'll get burned
with that weak fire of yours!
This might be bad.
I-Is this his true power?!
Seven counts left!
Are you scared?! Are you scared of me?!
Without Boosted Gear, you're nothing but trash!
Six counts left!
That was nothi-
You bastard... what did you do?
A-A cross?
Five!
A cross?
Our bishop is a former-sister.
I borrowed one of her former items.
It looks like you won’t be able to heal easily from
a holy power attack enhanced by Sacred Gear, right?
Four!
Impossible! Crosses should burn a devil's body!
He's using the power of the dragon to shield him!
It's impossible for him to hold-
Did you give your... left arm to the
dragon residing in the gauntlet... ?
Three!
If it's the arm of a dragon, this cross won't affect me!
This arm isn't my arm anymore.
Huh?!
You see. I can even hold a cross.
Are you crazy? You'll never get out of this alive!
Two!
So what?!
Issei sacrificed his own arm. He can't lose.
Please win and come back with Prez!
One!
My left arm is cheap if I can bring back Prez!
Count over!
Sorry. Time's up, kid.
You have to be kidding me! I'm almost done!
What can I sacrifice next?! My eye?! Legs?!
I'll give you anything!
Your body is physically limiting you.
You're saying I'm weak?
Damn it, why is this happening at such an important time?
When the power of the armor disappeared, I transferred a bit of the power to the jewel.
You can overwhelm Raiser Phoenix for a short time,
However that’s it. It won't be enough to beat the regeneration power of a Phoenix.
But even then!
I won't give up!
Now, let's have you sleep.
By the time you wake up, the festivities will be over with.
I'm not done...
You put out fire... with water, right?
Holy water?!
But against someone as strong
as Raiser-sama, holy water can't...
Boosted Gear Transfer!
Transfer!
Raiser's flame is...
But the effect of the enhanced holy water
extinguishes a lot of stamina and the soul.
Even if it’s a Phoenix who can come back to life from
ashes, he won't be able to recover from a soul drainage.
Soul?
The soul. It shows that even a Phoenix
doesn't have an immortal heart.
Asia was saying how devils are
weak against crosses and holy water
If I use both at the same time and reinforce
them, it's bound to cause real damage!
Kiba told me this "to widen my line of sight and
look towards the enemy and its surroundings."
Transfer!
Akeno-san told me this
"to gather the magical power that flows throughout your whole body."
To concentrate and feel the wave of the magical energy.
Like Koneko-chan told me,
"When you hit someone, aim at the middle of the body
and push it deep into their body accurately!"
W-Wait!
Do you understand that this engagement is
imperative for the future of devils?!
This isn't something a clueless brat like you should be meddling with!
I don't understand difficult things.
However, when I lost to you, I still
remembered one thing from that.
You made Prez cry!
And that's all I need to know to punch you!
I-I can't...
This me... !
Onii-sama!
If you've got a problem, come
to me. I'll fight you any day!
Issei... you... you!
I guess the match is over.
T-Thanks, Koneko-chan!
Good work!
You did well, Issei-kun!
I-It's nothing!
Get ready.
What?
There you go.
P-Prez?
Thank you, Issei! My Issei!
W-What?
A griffon.
Oh my. Since it's quite the occasion,
why don't you take her back, Issei?
M-Me?
That sounds nice. Can I ask you to do so?
I-If it's your order!
We'll be waiting in the club room!
I had that griffon ready as a last resort for him, actually.
If you'd used it for that, things
may have gotten messy.
Father and I have learned a lot from this.
Unfortunately, it seems this engagement didn't work out.
Is it really "unfortunate"?
Your expression suggests otherwise.
Welsh dragon, the Red Dragon, I didn't
think that it'll come to our side.
Vanishing Dragon. Perhaps for him to meet
the White Dragon won't be that far out.
Wow!
P-Prez.
You're such an idiot. You went through all of this for me.
It's nothing. After all, I managed to get you back.
You may have been able to succeed this time.

No matter how many times it is, I'll come to save you.
After all, I'm your pawn!
